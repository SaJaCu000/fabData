Rule	Text
1.0.	Game Concepts
1.0.	General
1.0.1.	The rules in this document apply to any game of Flesh and Blood.
1.0.1a	If an effect directly contradicts a rule contained in this document, the effect supersedes that rule.
1.0.1b	If a tournament rule contradicts a rule contained in this document or an effect, the tournament rule supersedes that rule or that effect.
1.0.2.	A rule or effect that states something can not happen takes precedence over any rule and/or effect that states that something can happen, subject to Rule 1.0.1a. Example: If one effect reads “You can’t play cards from your banished zone.” and another effect reads “You may play cards from your banished zone.”, the former effect takes precedence and the player can not play cards from their banished zone.
1.0.2a	A rule or effect that states that “only” something can happen, is functionally equivalent to a rule or effect that states everything else can not happen. Example: Three of a Kind has the text “[...] you may only play cards from arsenal.”, which is equivalent to “you can not play cards from anywhere other than arsenal.”. Even if an effect would allow you to play a card from your banished zone, you would not be able to play that card from the banished zone because of the effect generated by Three of a Kind.
1.1.	Players
1.1.1.	A player is a person participating in the game.
1.1.1a	To participate, a person must have a hero, a deck, a way to represent any tokens and counters that could be created by effects in their deck, a play-space, and a method to record life totals.
1.1.2.	A player’s hero is a hero card.
1.1.2a	This document distinguishes the player as the person participating in the game and the hero as the hero card of a player.
1.1.2b	A player plays the game as their hero and Card text makes no distinction between the player and their hero, identifying both identically; the term “you” refers to the player’s hero and the term “opponent” refers to the player’s opponent’s hero.
1.1.3.	A player’s deck is a collection of non-hero cards. A card can only be included in a player’s deck if the card’s supertypes are a subset of their hero’s supertypes. (See Section 2.10 - Supertypes) Example: If the hero card is Boltyn (supertypes of “Light” and “Warrior”), the deck can only include cards with the supertypes of “Light Warrior”, “Light”, “Warrior”, and cards with no supertypes (“Generic”).
1.1.3a	If an effect allows a player to start the game with one or more cards with supertypes that are not a subset of their hero’s supertypes, those cards may be included in their deck as long as they start the game as specified by the effect.
1.1.3b	A player’s inventory is a collection of equipment and weapon cards in the player’s deck.
1.1.4.	A player’s play-space is an area for designated zones owned by (and shared with) the player. (See Chapter 3 - Zones)
1.1.5.	In a game, a player’s opponents include all other players.
1.1.6.	Clockwise order is the order of players starting from the given player and progressing clockwise among the players when viewed from above. The next player in clockwise order is the player to the left of the given player.
1.2.	Objects
1.2.1.	An object is a card, token, macro, or layer in the game.
1.2.2.	A permanent is a card or token in the arena that is designated as a permanent by a rule or effect.
1.2.2a	A permanent remains a permanent until it leaves the arena.
1.2.3.	Objects have one or more properties. (See Chapter 2 - Object Properties)
1.2.4.	An object has one or more object identities that can be referred to. Rules in this document and effects typically describe objects using their object identity as the noun. Example: Lunging Press has the text “Target attack action card gains +1{p}.”, which identifies the target of the effect, using the “card” object identity as the noun.
1.2.4a	An object has the object identity “object”.
1.2.4b	An object with a name property and/or moniker has the object identity of that name and/or moniker. (See Section 2.6 - Name) Example: Dorinthea, Quicksilver Prodigy has the text “The first time Dawnblade, Resplendent gains go again each turn, [...]”, which identifies an object using the name “Dawnblade, Resplendent” as an object identity.
1.2.4c	A card or token has the object identity of its types and subtypes, except for the subtype attack. Example: Ironsong Determination has the text “Target weapon gains +1{p} and dominate until end of turn.”, which identifies an object using the type “weapon” as an object identity.
1.2.4d	A card with the subtype attack on the stack, an attack-layer, or an attacking object has the object identity “attack”. (See Rule 7.0.2) Example: Oath of the Arknight has the text “Your next Runeblade attack this turn gains +3{p}.”, which identifies either a Runeblade attack action card on the stack, or attack- layer created by a Runeblade source, or an attacking Runeblade object; using “attack” as an object identity.
1.2.4e	A card has the object identity “card”.
1.2.4f	A token has the object identity “token”.
1.2.4g	An activated-layer has the object identity “activated ability”.
1.2.4h	A triggered-layer has the object identity “triggered effect”.
1.2.5.	Last known information (LKI) about an object is a snapshot of the state of an object immediately before it ceased to exist.
1.2.5a	If rule or effect requires information about a specific object that no longer exists, instead it uses last known information about that object to fulfill that requirement. Otherwise, if a rule or effect does not specifically refer to that object, last known information is not used. Example: Endless Arrow has the text “When Endless Arrow hits, put it into your hand.”. If Endless Arrow hits, it is put into the player’s hand. The chain link of Endless Arrow then holds the last known information about Endless Arrow, so that if it had the ability “go again” before it was put into hand the player would still gain an action point when the link step begins.
1.2.5b	Last known information about an object includes all parameters, history, and effects applicable to that object at the time it still existed.
1.2.5c	Last known information about an object is immutable - it can not be altered. Rules and effects that would modify the object that no longer exists do not modify the last known information about an object; this may cause effects to fail. Example: Luminaris has the text “If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, Illusionist attacks you control have go again.”. If you controlled Illusionist attack as a chain link on the combat chain, but it was removed, and then you put a yellow card in your pitch zone to met Luminaris’s condition, the chain link does not have go again because the last known information about the attack can not be altered.
1.2.5d	Last known information about an object is not an object itself - it is not a legal target for rules and effects.
1.2.6.	The owner of an object is the same as the card, token, macro, or layer that represents it, otherwise it has no owner.
1.2.7.	The controller of an object is the same as the card, token, macro, or layer that represents it. An object does not have a controller if it is not in the arena or on the stack.
1.3.	Cards
1.3.1.	A card is represented by an official Flesh and Blood card, which is defined by tournament rules.
1.3.1a	The properties of a card are determined by the properties printed on the latest version of the official Flesh and Blood card that represents it, or as specified by any errata published by Legend Story Studios, whichever is most recent. These properties are the copyable properties of the card. (See Chapter 2 - Object Properties)
1.3.2.	A card is distinct from another card if it has a different name or pitch from that other card. Example: Sink Below with 1 pitch (and a red color bar) is distinct from Sink Below with 2 pitch (and a yellow color bar).
1.3.3.	The owner of a card is the player who started the game with that card as their hero or as part of their deck. (See Rule 1.1.3)
1.3.4.	The controller of a card is its owner as it enters the arena or the player who played that card. 3
1.4.	Tokens
1.4.1.	A token is any permanent in the arena that is neither a card nor a macro. Tokens are created by effects. 1.4.1a	A token is not a card, even if it is represented by an official Flesh and Blood card. (See Rule 1.3.1) Example: The official Flesh and Blood card Quicken is a token. This is indicated by the term “token” printed in the type box.
1.4.1b	The properties of a token are defined by the effect that created it - these properties are the copyable properties of the token. (See Section 8.6 - Token Keywords)
1.4.1c	A token is not considered part of a player’s deck. (See Rule 1.1.3)
1.4.2.	If a token leaves the arena and it is not a sub-object, it ceases to exist. (See Rule 3.0.14)
1.4.3.	The owner of a token is the player instructed to create it.
1.4.4.	The controller of a token is its owner as it enters the arena.
1.5.	Macros
1.5.1.	A macro is an object in the arena that is neither a card nor a token. Macros are objects used to generate static-continuous effects that exist over multiple turns or indefinitely.
1.5.1a	A macro is not a card, even if it is represented by an official Flesh and Blood card. (See Rule 1.3.1)
1.5.1b	The properties of a macro are defined by the rule or effect that created it.
1.5.1c	A macro is not considered part of a player’s deck. (See Rule 1.1.3) 1.5.2.	If a macro leaves the arena, it ceases to exist.
1.5.3.	The owner of a macro is the player instructed to create it.
1.5.4.	The controller of a macro is its owner as it enters the arena.
1.6.	Layers
1.6.1.	A layer is an object on the stack (see Section 3.14 - Stack) that is yet to be resolved. A layer is represented by a card or is an object created by an ability or effect.
1.6.1a	A card-layer is a layer represented by a card on the stack.
1.6.1b	An activated-layer is a layer created by an activated ability. An activated-layer can only exist on the stack. (See Section 5.2 - Activated Abilities) Example: Energy Potion has the text “Instant – Destroy Energy Potion: Gain {r}{r}”, which is an activated ability. When this ability is activated, it creates an activated-layer on the stack with the resolution ability “Gain {r}{r}”.
1.6.1c	A triggered-layer is a layer created by a triggered effect. A triggered-layer can only exist on the stack. (See Section 6.6 - Triggered Effects) Example: Snatch has the text “When Snatch hits, draw a card.”, which is a triggered effect. When this effect is triggered, it creates a triggered-layer to be put on the stack with the resolution ability “Draw a card”.
1.6.2.	An attack-layer is an activated-layer (activated-attack) or triggered-layer (triggered-attack) with the attack ability (see Rule 8.3.1), and represents its source as an attack on the stack before the source becomes a chain link attack on the combat chain.
1.6.2a	An attack-layer is an extension of the source it represents. The attack-layer is considered to be its source for rules and effects unless otherwise specified by a rule. Example: Sharpen Steel has the text “Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}.”, which is an effect that applies only to the next weapon attack. If you create an attack-layer with a weapon, Sharpen Steel’s effect will apply to the attack-layer because it is considered to be a weapon (and an attack) for rules and effects.
1.6.2b	An attack-layer is considered a separate object from its source for effects that applies specifically to attacks. Effects that refer to and apply to the source also refer to and apply to any attack-layer created by the source, but effects that specifically refer to or apply to the attack-layer do not refer to or apply to the source. Example: Sharpen Steel has the text “Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}.”, which applies only to the attack-layer created by a weapons abilities and then applies to the weapon as an attack on the combat chain; it does not continue to apply to the weapon when the weapon is no longer that specific attack on the combat chain. Example: Ironsong Determination has the text “Target weapon gains +1{p} and dominate until end of turn.”, which applies to a weapon object, and by extension, any attack-layers created by its abilities.
1.6.2c	If the source of an attack-layer ceases to exist, the attack-layer does not resolve.
1.6.3.	The owner of a card-layer is the player who owns the card. The owner of an activated-layer is the player who activated the activated ability. The owner of a triggered-layer is the player who controlled the source of the triggered effect when the triggered-layer was created.
1.6.4.	The controller of a layer is the player that put it on the stack.
1.7.	Abilities
1.7.1.	An ability is a property of an object that influences the game by generating effects or by creating a layer on the stack that resolves and generates effects.
1.7.2.	The base abilities of a card are determined by its rules text. (See Section 2.11 - Text Box)
1.7.3.	The base abilities of a token, macro, or layer are defined by the rule, effect, or ability that created it.
1.7.4.	There are 3 categories of abilities: activated abilities, resolution abilities, and static abilities. An ability is categorized based on how it generates effects.
1.7.4a	Activated abilities can be activated by a player to put an activated-layer on the stack. (See Section 5.2 - Activated Abilities)
1.7.4b	Resolution abilities generate effects when a layer with the ability resolves on the stack. (See Section 5.3 - Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers)
1.7.4c	Static abilities simply generate effects. (See Section 5.4 - Static Abilities)
1.7.5.	An activated ability can only be activated when it is functional. A resolution or static ability only generates its effects when it is functional. An ability is functional when its source is public and in the arena; otherwise, it is non-functional, with the following exceptions:
1.7.5a	An ability of a non-permanent defending object (see Rule 3.5.4d) is non-functional unless the ability is an activated ability that specifies it can be activated when the object is defending, a triggered ability with a trigger condition that includes the object defending, or a static ability that is stated as an exception. Example: Rally the Rearguard has the text “Once per Turn Instant — Discard a card: Rally the Rearguard gains +3 {d} . Activate this ability only while Rally the Rearguard is defending.”, which is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card because the activated ability states it can only be activated when the card is defending.
1.7.5b	An activated ability that specifies it can be activated when its source is private and/or in a zone outside the arena is functional when the source meets that condition. (See Rule 5.2.4) Example: Guardian of the Shadowrealm has the text “Action - {r}{r}: Return Guardian of the Shadowrealm to your hand. Active this ability only while Guardian of the Shadowrealm is in your banished zone.”, which is functional when it is in the owner’s banished zone.
1.7.5c	A resolution ability is functional when its source object resolves as a layer on the stack, otherwise, it is non-functional. (See Section 5.3 - Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers) Example: Sigil of Solace has the text “Gain 3{h}”, which is a resolution ability that is functional as the card resolves as a layer on the stack to produce its effect.
1.7.5d	A meta-static ability is functional outside the game. (See Rule 5.4.3) Example: The Specialization keyword is a meta-static ability that prevents the player from including the card in their deck if the specialization does not match their hero card’s first name, which is functional outside the game.
1.7.5e	A play-static ability is functional when its source is played. (See Rule 5.4.4) Example: Ghostly Visit has the text “You may play Ghostly Visit from your banished zone.”, which is a play-static ability that is functional when playing Ghostly Visit, because it affects the rules of how it is allowed to be played.
1.7.5f	A property-static ability is functional when its source is in any zone, and outside the game. (See Rule 5.4.5) Example: The {p} and {d} of Mutated Mass are defined by a property-static ability which is functional at all times, based on the current total number of different costed cards in the pitch zone in the current game state.
1.7.5g	A while-static ability is functional when its while-condition is met. (See Rule 1.8.3c) Example: Yinti Yanti has the text “While Yinti Yanti is defending and you control an aura, it has +1 {d} .”, which is a while-static ability that is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card because it has a while-condition that is met when the card is defending.
1.7.5h	A static ability is functional when its source resolves as a layer on the stack and/or as its source enters the arena. Example: Teklo Core has the text “Teklo Core enters the arena with 2 steam counters on it.”, which is a static ability that is functional as Teklo Core enters the arena, so it will enter with two steam counters existing on it.
1.7.5i	A triggered-static ability, with a triggered condition that its source is outside the arena, is functional when the source meets that condition. Example: Back Alley Breakline has the text “When an activated ability or action card effect puts Back Alley Breakline face up into a zone from your deck, gain 1 action point.”, which is a triggered-static ability that is functional a zone when an activated ability or action card effect puts it into that zone from the deck.
1.7.5j	A static ability, with a replacement effect that modifies the event of its source moving zones, is functional when the source meets that condition. Example: Drone of Brutality has the text “If Drone of Brutality would be put into your graveyard from anywhere, instead put it on the bottom of your deck.”, which is a static ability with a vreplacement effect that is functional when Drone of Brutality would be moved to the graveyard zone.
1.7.6.	A modal ability is a resolution ability that contains a choice of modes for what abilities the source has, or what effects the ability will generate. A modal ability typically contains the phrase “choose [X] [CONDITIONS?]; [MODES]” where X is a cardinal number or a description of the number of modes to choose, CONDITIONS (if any) specifies one or more conditions for selecting modes, and MODES is a list of modes that can be selected.
1.7.6a	Modes of an ability are declared as the source card, activated-layer, or triggered-layer is added as a layer on the stack. (See Rule 5.1.4	and Rule 6.6.6a)
1.7.6b	If the ability allows the player to select two or more modes, they can not select the same mode more than once, unless specified by the ability. Example: Art of War has the text “Choose 2; [...]” followed by four modal options. Because the ability does not state that the player can choose the same option more than once, two distinct modes must be selected.
1.7.6c	If the same mode is selected more than once, the modes are considered separate and do not create a compound event (See Rule 1.9.2). If the mode contains a targeted effect, the same target(s) may be selected for each time the mode is selected. Example: Blood on Her Hands has the text “Target 1H weapon has +1{p} while attacking this turn.”, which is a mode that can be selected more than once. As a targeted effect, the player may target the same 1H weapon for each time it is chosen as a mode.
1.7.6d	Once the modes of a modal ability have been selected, those modes determine the abilities/effects of the source for rules and effects.
1.7.7.	A connected ability pair is a pair of abilities where the parameters and/or events of one connected ability (leading ability) are specifically referred to by the effect(s) of the other connected ability (following ability). Example: Reckless Swing has the text “As an additional cost to play Reckless Swing, discard a random card.”, which is a leading play-static ability that requires the player to discard a card, and “If the discarded card has 6 or more Attack, deal 2 damage to the attacking hero.”, which is a following resolution ability with an effect that directly refers to the card discarded from the event generated by an effect in the leading ability.
1.7.7a	An ability can be part of one or more connected ability pairs. An ability can be both a leading and following ability for different connected ability pairs.
1.7.7b	If a following ability can not refer to the parameters and/or events of the leading ability, or if there are no parameters and/or events to refer to, the relevant effects of the following ability fail.
1.7.7c	If an effect adds a connected ability pair (both the leading and following abilities) to an object, they are connected on that object and the added following ability will only refer to the added leading ability. If only one of the abilities is added, or both abilities are added by separate effects, then they are not connected on that object they are added to.
1.7.8.	The abilities of an object can be modified.
1.7.9.	The source of an ability is the card or token that has that ability. The source of abilities of an activated- layer or triggered-layer is the same as the source of the ability that created that layer.
1.7.9a	Activated-layers and triggered-layers exist independently of their source. If the source of an activated-layer or triggered-layer ceases to exist, it does not prevent the resolution of that layer.
1.7.10.	The controller of an activated-layer is the player who activated its source. The controller of a triggered-layer is the player who controlled its source when it triggered - if the source has no controller, the controller of the triggered-layer is player who owns the source.
1.8.	Effects
1.8.1.	An effect is generated by an ability or another effect, and can change the game state by producing events or applying changes to objects or the game itself. When a layer resolves, a static ability becomes functional, a card/ability with an alternative/additional effect-cost is played/activated, or the conditions of another effect is met, it may generate an ordered sequence of one or more discrete and/or continuous effects.
1.8.2.	An optional effect is an effect that is not compulsory to generate or apply. An optional effect typically contains the term “may”. When an optional effect would be generated, or would apply to objects or the game, the player instructed by the effect chooses whether or not to generate or apply the effect.
1.8.3.	A conditional effect is an effect that is dependent on a condition to be met. A conditional effect is typically written in the format “(If / During) [CONDITION], [EFFECT]”, where CONDITION is the condition that must be met for EFFECT to be generated/applied. Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “If [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]” to denote a triggered effect. (See Section 6.6 - Triggered Effects)
1.8.3a	A conditional effect, written in the format “Otherwise [Effect]”, is an effect that is conditional on the opposite of a preceding conditional effect. This effect’s condition is met only when the preceding effect’s condition is not met. Example: Runeblade Incantation has the text “At the beginning of your action phase, remove a verse counter from Runeblood Incantation. If you do, create a Runechant token. Otherwise, destroy Runeblood Incantation.”, the latter part of which is a conditional discrete effect that is conditional on the failure to remove a verse counter from Runeblade Incantation.
1.8.3b	A conditional effect, written in the format “[EFFECT] unless [OPPCONDITION]”, is an effect that is conditional on the opposite of the OPPCONDITION. This effect’s condition is only met when the OPPCONDITION is not met, or the OPPCONDITION is an effect that fails (see Rule 1.8.8). If the OPPCONDITION is an effect instead of a condition, it is an optional effect. Note: An effect that reads “Deal 2 damage to the attacking hero unless they pay {r}.” can be read as “The attacking hero may pay {r}. If they don’t, deal 2 damage to them.” Example: Pitfall Trap has the text “Deal 2 damage to the attacking hero unless they pay {r}.”, which is a conditional discrete effect, that is conditional on the attacking hero not paying the asset-cost.
1.8.3c	A conditional effect, written in the format “[EFFECT] while [CONDITION]”, is an effect that only applies as along as CONDITION is met. The CONDITION is evaluated at all times while the effect exists. If the effect applies to one or more subjects, CONDITION is evaluated per subject. Example: Parable of Humility has the text “Attack action cards controlled by an opposing hero have -1{p} while attacking and defending.”, which is a conditional static-continuous effect that applies to more than one object and a condition that is checked per object that it applies to.
1.8.3d	If an effect is conditional on the properties of an object changing within a time-frame, the condition is only met if the change occurs to that object from one game state to another, and the change occurs within the specified time-frame. Changes that occur as an object becomes public, satisfy the condition of the change occurring. Example: Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements, has the text “[...] if [...] no card or token controlled by a hero has had {p} or {d} increased this turn, destroy Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements.”, which is an effect that is conditional on a the power and defense of a card not changing. If a card’s power or defense is increased from a continuous effect, even if that continuous effect only applies when the card is played or defended with, Korshem will not be destroyed at the end of that turn. If a card’s power or defense was increased in a previous turn, it will not prevent Korshem from being destroyed at the end of the current turn.
1.8.4.	A targeted effect is an effect where the target parameters are declared as the object with the ability that generates it is put onto the stack. Targeted effects always contain the phrase “target [DESCRIPTION]” or “[DESCRIPTION] (target/targets)” where DESCRIPTION is the specifics of one or more legal targets for the effect.
1.8.4a	Only objects in the arena or on the stack are targetable (can be selected a legal target), unless the effect specifies the legal target as a zone or an object that does not exist in the arena or on the stack. Example: Memorial Ground (red) has the text “Put target attack action card with cost 2 or less from your graveyard on top of your deck.” which describes a legal target as a card in the graveyard as opposed to a card in the arena or on the stack.
1.8.4b	The same legal target can not be declared more than once for any one instance of the target phrase.
1.8.4c	An effect that specifies one or more subjects to affect, but does not use the term “target”, is not a targeted effect. Non-target subjects do not need to be declared until the effect is generated. Example: Remembrance has the text “Shuffle up to 3 action cards from your graveyard into your deck.”, which is not a targeted effect because it does not use the term “target” before the specified subjects of the effect.
1.8.4d	If the DESCRIPTION of a legal target is “any”, then the legal targets are dependent on the application of the effect. In this context, a legal target is any target that does not cause the effect to fail for the current game state.
1.8.4e	If a targeted effect is optional, the player(s) instructed are not required to select a target. If a player does not select a target, the optional effect is not generated.
1.8.5.	If the parameters of an effect are undetermined at the time the effect is generated, the player instructed by the effect determines the parameters of the effect. If no legal parameters exist, then any part of the effect related to those parameters fail. Example: Remembrance has the text “Shuffle up to 3 action cards from your graveyard into your deck.”. This effect does not require targets when Remembrance is played on the stack, so when the effect is generated upon resolution, up to three action cards must be determined by the controlling player.
1.8.5a	If two or more players are instructed to determine the parameters of an effect, those players determine the parameters in clockwise order, starting with the turn player. (See Rule 1.1.6)
1.8.5b	If the parameters of an effect includes determining an object, the player can only determine objects that are public as parameters for the effect. (See Rule 3.0.3) Example: Oasis Respite has the text “Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target hero this turn by a source of your choice.”, which has a parameter that must be a public object.
1.8.6.	If an effect refers to the value of a property, it infers the existence of the property as well as its value. If an object does not have that property, it does not meet the condition of the existence of the property and thus the condition of the value of the property. Example: Harmonized Kodachi has the text “While you have a card in your pitch zone with cost 0, [...]”, which can be interpreted as “While you have a card in your pitch zone with the cost property and that value of that property is 0, [...]”. This means a card without the cost property, such as Heart of Fyendal, will not satisfy the condition if it is in the pitch zone. Example: Find Center has the text “Find Center can’t be defended by cards with cost less than the number of chain links you control, [...]”, which can be interpreted as “Find Center can not be defended by cards with the cost property, if the value of the cost property is less than the number of chain links you control, [...]”. This means cards without the cost property, such as Ironrot Helm, would be able to defend the attack. Example: Mutated Mass has the text “Mutated Mass’s {p} and {d} are equal to twice the number of cards in your pitch zone with different costs.”, which can be interpreted as “Mutated Mass’s {p} and {d} is equal to twice the number of cards in your pitch zone with the cost property, that have different costs.”. This means cards without the cost property, such as Heart of Fyendal, will not satisfy the condition (and be included in the calculation) if it is in the pitch zone.
1.8.6a	If an effect requires the value of a numeric property from a specific object without that property, then zero is used as the value for the purpose of the effect. Example: Ravenous rabble has the text “Reveal the top card of your deck. Ravenous Rabble gets -X{p}, where X is the pitch value of the card revealed this way.”. If the revealed card for this effect was Gorganian Tome, which does not have the pitch property, the value of X would be zero.
1.8.7.	If an effect instructs that a player may to do something as though a condition were true, the condition is considered met for the purposes of the applicable effect only.
1.8.8.	An effect fails if the target(s) of the effect cease to exist, if there are no legal parameters at the time the effect is generated, or if the events it creates fail to occur.
1.8.9.	The source of an effect is the same as the source of the ability or effect that generated it, unless otherwise specified by the effect. Example: Electrify has the text “The next time an attack action card hits a hero this turn, it deals 3 damage to them.”, which is a delayed-triggered effect that triggers to deal damage, specifying the source of the damage effect as the attack action card that caused the effect to trigger.
1.8.10.	The controller of an effect is the same as the controller of the ability or effect that generated it, unless otherwise specified by the effect.
1.9.	Events
1.9.1.	An event is a change in the game state produced by the resolution of a layer, the result of an effect, a transition of turn phase or combat step, or an action taken by a player. An event may involve physically changing the game state through one or more instructions - it can be modified by replacement effects (see Section 6.4 - Replacement Effects) and can trigger triggered effects (see Section 6.6 - Triggered Effects).
1.9.1a	If an event involves instructions that are performed on elements outside the game, that event can not be modified by replacement effects or trigger triggered effects within the game, unless the event directly interacts with the game. Example: Go Bananas has the text “Open and reveal a booster pack of Flesh and Blood and put all cards with the chosen name into your hand.”, which creates a ‘reveal’ event and a ‘put’ event as part of its resolution. The ‘reveal’ event only operates outside of the game, so any replacement effects and triggered effects within the game do not interact with it. The ‘put’ event directly interacts with the game by putting an object into a game zone, so replacement effects and triggered effects within the game may interact with it.
1.9.2.	A compound event is an event that involves performing the same instructions more than once. An effect that produces a compound event is typically written in a compact format, where the effect specifies to repeat an instruction a number of times. When a compound event occurs, it is expanded, and the instructions occur as individual events. Example: Tome of Harvests has the text “Draw 3 cards.”, which is an effect written in compact form, that produces a compound event that involves drawing a card three times. Each draw is performed as a individual event: draw a card, draw a card, draw a card.
1.9.2a	If a triggered effect triggers from a compound event, it does not trigger again for any of the individual events of that compound event. Example: Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements, has the text “Whenever a hero reveals 1 or more cards, [...]”, which is a triggered effect that triggers on the compound event of revealing one or more cards, but does not then trigger on any of the individual events from that compound event.
1.9.2b	If a replacement effect replaces a compound event, it can not replace any of the individual events of that compound event. Example: Mordred Tide has the text “Until end of turn, if you would create a Runechant token, instead create that many plus 1.”, which replaces the compound event that creates X Runechant tokens with a compound event that creates X + 1 Runechant tokens. It does not then replace each of the X + 1 individual “create a Runechant token” event with “create 2 Runechant tokens”.
1.9.3.	A composite event is an event that is made up of one or more internal events. An effect that produces a composite event typically uses an effect keyword. (See Section 8.5 - Effect Keywords) Example: When an attack deals damage during the damage step of combat, the “hit” composite event occurs, which contains the internal event of “deal damage”.
1.9.3a	If a composite event occurs, and the composite event and/or internal event(s) would trigger the triggered effect, the triggered effect only triggers once on the composite event.
1.9.3b	If a rule or effect prevents a triggered effect from triggering on a composite event and/or its internal event(s), then the triggered effect does not trigger on the composite event. Example: Stamp Authority has the text “Attack action card effects do not trigger when they hit.”, which prevents a triggered effect from triggering on the composite event “hit”. If a triggered effect from an attack action card would trigger on damage being dealt, and the attack action card “hits”, the effect will not trigger because the damage dealt is an internal event of the “hit” composite event.
1.9.3c	Replacement effects that partially modify internal events, do not modify the composite event that contains it, and therefore the composite event still occurs. The only exception is the hit event as part of the Damage Step of combat (see Rule 7.5.3). Example: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from the hand to the graveyard. If a replacement effect replaces the destination of the move event, then the discard event is still considered to occur.
1.9.3d	If no internal events of a composite event occur, then the composite event is considered not to have occurred, and triggered effects that trigger on the composite event and/or internal event(s) do not trigger. Example: Discard is a composite event that involves moving a card from the hand to the graveyard. If a replacement effect replaces the move event entirely, then the discard event is considered not to occur and abilities that trigger on discard are not triggered.
1.10.	Game State
1.10.1.	A game state is a moment in the game. The game transitions between states when players make actions or decisions, or when game state processes occur.
1.10.2.	When the game transitions to a new game state, the following game state actions are performed first: 1.10.2a	First, if one or more heroes have died, their player loses the game (or the game ends in a draw). (See Section 4.5 - Ending a Game)
1.10.2b	Second, if one or more living objects in the arena have 0 life total, they are cleared simultaneously as a single event. Living objects that cease to exist are considered to have died. (See Rule 2.5.1	and Rule 3.0.12)
1.10.2c	Third and finally, if a triggered-layer has been created it is added to the stack. If two or more triggered-layers have been created, they are added to the stack in an order chosen by the turn player.
1.10.3.	If a player makes an illegal action, or starts to make an action that becomes illegal to complete, the game state is reversed to the legal state before that action started.
1.10.3a	Triggered effects do not trigger as a result of the action being reversed.
1.10.3b	Replacement effects can not replace any event as a result of the action being reversed.
1.10.3c	If the game state can not be reversed, as much as possible about the state is reversed and the game continues as though it were the last legal state before the reversal.
1.11.	Priority
1.11.1.	Priority is a game state concept that describes which player (if any), may play a card, activate an ability, or pass priority to the next player.
1.11.2.	Only one player can have priority at any point in time. A player who has priority is the “active player”. A player who does not have priority is an “inactive player”.
1.11.3.	The Action Phase is the only phase when players get priority. Within the action phase, players do not get priority during the Damage Step or Close Step of combat. At the beginning of the action phase, during most steps of combat, and after the resolution of a layer, the turn player gains priority. (See Section 4.2 - Start Phase, Chapter 7 - Combat, and Section 5.3 - Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers)
1.11.4.	The active player may pass priority to the next player, referred to as “pass”.
1.11.4a	If a player passes, priority is given to the next player in clockwise order (see Rule 1.1.6). Typically, if all players pass in succession without playing any cards or activating any abilities, and the stack is not empty, the top layer of the stack resolves (see Section 5.3 - Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers) - otherwise if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends (see Chapter 4 - Game Structure and Chapter 7 - Combat).
1.11.5.	When a player plays a card, activates an ability, or passes, they lose priority until they receive it again from a rule. Players do not have priority while playing a card, activating an ability, resolving a layer, during a game process, and/or game static actions.
1.12.	Numbers and Symbols
1.12.1.	Numbers are always integers.
1.12.1a	If a rule or effect would calculate a fractional number and does not specify to round up or down, the number is rounded towards zero. Example: An effect that would calculate the number 3.5 would be rounded down to 3, but the number -3.5 would be rounded up to -3.
1.12.1b	If a rule or effect requires a player to choose a number, the number selected must be a non-negative integer - zero and above.
1.12.2.	The letter X is used to represent a value that starts undefined and is defined later by a rule or effect.
1.12.2a	If an object has a property with the value X, and the value of X undefined, the object is still considered to have that property and the value of X is evaluated to be zero.
1.12.2b	If an object has a property with the value X, and the value of X is defined, it remains defined until the object ceases to exist.
1.12.2c	If there are two or more undefined values in the same context, the letters Y and Z may be also used to represent those undefined values.
1.12.3.	The asterisk symbol (*) is used to represent a value that is defined by a meta static ability.
1.12.3a	If an object has a property with the value (*) and the property-static ability can not be used to define the value, the object is still considered to have that property and the value of (*) is evaluated to be zero. Example: Mutated Mass has an ability that defines its power and defense as double the total number of distinct costs of cards in the pitch zone. Outside of a game, this ability can not be used to define the power and defense, so they are instead evaluated to be zero.
1.12.3b	If an object has a property with the value (*) and the ability can be used to define the value, then (*) is evaluated according to the ability.
1.12.4.	Symbols are typically used to represent the value of specified properties. (See Chapter 2 - Object Properties)
1.12.4a	The defense symbol is {d} and represents a defense value.
1.12.4b	The intellect symbol is {i} and represents a intellect value.
1.12.4c	The life symbol is {h} and represents a life value.
1.12.4d	The power symbol is {p} and represents a power value. It is also used to refer to physical damage (see Rule 8.5.3e).
1.12.4e	The resource symbol is {r} and represents a resource value.
1.13.	Assets
1.13.1.	An asset is a point of a given type, owned by a player. There are two types of assets: action points and resource points.
1.13.2.	An action point is an asset that is typically used to play an action card and/or activate an action ability.
1.13.2a	The turn player can gain action points from the following: at the start of their action phase (see Section 4.3 - Action Phase), the ability go again (see Rule 8.3.5), and effects that grant the player action points.
1.13.2b	A non-turn player can not gain action points. If a non-turn player would gain an action point from a rule or effect, they instead do not gain any action points. Example: Lead the Charge has the text “The next time you play an action card with cost 0 or greater this turn, gain 1 action point. Go again”. If a non-turn player played (as an instant) Lead the Charge (red), they would not gain an action point from the ability “go again”. If they then played an action card with cost 0 (as an instant), they would not gain an action point from the delayed-triggered effect of Lead the Charge.
1.13.3.	A resource point is an asset that is typically used to play cards and activate abilities.
1.13.3a	A player can gain resource points from the following: pitching cards during the payment of an asset-cost that requires resource points (see Rule 1.14.3), and effects that grant the player resource points.
1.14.	Costs
1.14.1.	A cost is the requirement of payment from a player incurred by playing a card, activating an ability, or resolving/applying an effect. A cost requires the payment of assets (asset-costs) and/or the successful resolution of effects (effect-costs).
1.14.2.	An asset-cost is a cost that requires the payment of one or more assets (see Section 1.13 - Assets). To pay an asset-cost as a player, the player must have or gain assets of the appropriate type equal to, or greater than, the cost to be paid; then those the asset-cost amounts are subtracted from the player’s assets and the cost is considered paid.
1.14.2a	If a player must pay a resource cost less than or equal to the number of resource points they have, that player must use those resource points to pay the resource cost. If not, then the player may pitch cards one at a time until they have enough resource points to pay the cost. (See Rule 1.14.3) Example: A player has 1 resource point and plays a card with 3 cost (more than the number of resources they have). If the player pitches a 3-pitch card, generating 3 resources, they have finished paying the asset-cost of the card, have 1 resource point left over, and can no longer pitch cards because there are no more costs to pay. If the player pitches a 1-pitch card, generating 1 resource, they still have 1 resource left to pay and must continue pitching cards until the asset-cost is paid.
1.14.2b	If an asset-cost involves paying two or more types of assets, the player declares the order in which the costs will be paid before any cost is paid.
1.14.2c	If a player does not have enough assets and can not generate any additional assets to pay an asset-cost, the cost is can not be paid and the game state is reversed to before the cost is paid. If the asset-cost is mandatory and part of another action, the entire action is reversed. (See Section 1.10.3	- Game State).
1.14.3.	To pitch a card as a player, the player moves the card from their hand to the pitch zone and generates resource points equal to the pitch value of the card pitched.
1.14.3a	A card can not be pitched if it does not have the pitch property. (See Section 2.7 - Pitch)
1.14.3b	A card can not be pitched this way if there is no resource cost to pay, or if the player has resource points equal to or greater than the resource cost to be paid. 1.14.3c	Pitching a card is an event that can trigger and be replaced by effects.
1.14.4.	An effect-cost is a cost that requires the payment in the form of generating one or more effects. To pay an effect-cost, the player must be able to successfully generate and resolve the specified costs. Example: Hope Merchant’s Hood has the text “Instant – Destroy Hope Merchant’s Hood: Shuffle any number of cards from your hand into your deck, then draw that many cards.”, which is an activated ability with an effect-cost of destroying Hope Merchant’s Hood.
1.14.4a	If an effect-cost involves generating two or more effects, the player declares the order in which the effects will be generated.
1.14.4b	Before the effect-cost is paid, if any of the effects can not be generated due to a rule or effect, or the effects can not resolve successfully based on the current game state, the cost can not be paid and the game state is reversed to before the cost is paid. If the effect-cost is mandatory and part of another action, the entire action is reversed. (See Section 1.10.3	- Game State).
1.14.4c	During the payment of an effect-cost, if the events of any effects are replaced and can not be successfully resolved, the cost is still considered paid.
1.14.5.	A cost that is represented by “0”, or a cost that in which all asset-costs reduced to zero and there are no effect-costs, is still considered a cost which is paid by acknowledging the zero cost.
1.15.	Counters
1.15.1.	A counter is a physical marker placed on an object in the arena. A counter is not an object and does not have properties. The identity of a counter is defined by its name or symbol. Counters with the same name or symbol are functionally identical and interchangeable.
1.15.2.	When a counter is on an object, it modifies its properties and/or interacts with effects.
1.15.3.	When an object leaves the arena the counters on that object cease to exist. When a counter is removed from an object it ceases to exist.
1.15.4.	If a counter would be added to an object that has a diametrically opposing counter on it, both diametrically opposing counters remain on the object. Example: If a -1{p} counter is placed on an object with a +1{p} counter on it, they both remain on the object. The counters do not cancel each other out and they are not removed from the object simply because they are diametrically opposing.
2.	Object Properties
2.0.	General
2.0.1.	A property is an attribute of an object that defines how the object interacts with rules and effects of the game. There are 13 properties an object may have: abilities (see Section 1.7 - Abilities), color strip, cost, defense, intellect, life, name, pitch, power, subtypes, supertypes, text box, and type.
2.0.1a	An ability is a property, not an object. However, activated abilities have the object properties cost and type, for the purposes of rules and effects.
2.0.2.	The properties of a card are defined by the information printed on the official Flesh and Blood card. If a property is not printed on the official Flesh and Blood card, the card it represents does not have that property.
2.0.2a	If an errata has been published for a given card, the properties of that card are defined by the corrections in that errata. (See http://fabtcg.com/errata)
2.0.3.	A numeric property is a property that has a numeric value. The value of some numeric properties can be modified by effects and/or counters to produce a modified value. The copyable value of the numeric property is typically the value that the object starts its existence with.
2.0.3a	An effect that modifies the value of a numeric property does not modify the base value of that property unless otherwise specified by the effect. Example: An effect that specifies an object to “gain”, “get”, “has”, “have”, “lose”, “plus”, or “minus” a property-related value, modifies the value of the property but does not change the base value unless it specifically uses the term “base”.
2.0.3b	A numeric property is considered to have increased/decreased if the modified value is greater/less than its previous value, or copyable value if there is no previous value. Example: Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements has the text “[...], if [...] no card or token controlled by a hero has had {p} or {d} increased this turn, destroy Korshem, Crossroads of the Elements.”. If a private card is played and an effect that increases power is applies to it as it is played, the property is considered to have increased because it had no previous power value (due to being private) and its current modified power is greater than its printed power; therefore it will satisfy Korshem’s condition.
2.0.3c	A numeric property can not have a negative base or modified value. If one or more effects would set or reduce the base or modified value of a numeric property to be less than zero, instead they set or reduce it to zero.
2.0.3d	A +1 or −1 property-related counter on an object, modifies the value of the property but does not change the base value.
2.0.4.	An object is considered to have gained a property, or part of a property, if it did not have that property/part before, but currently does. An object is considered to have lost a property, or part of a property, if it had that property/part but currently does not.
2.0.5.	The source of a property is the object that property is an attribute of.
2.1.	Color Strip
2.1.1.	Color Strip is a visual representation of the printed pitch of a card.
2.1.2.	The color strip of a card is typically located at the top of a card. The printed pitch of a card determines the color strip of the card. Cards with a printed pitch of 1, 2, and 3, typically have a color strip of red, yellow, and blue respectively. A card with no printed pitch typically does not have a color strip. • A card with a red color strip is considered red for the purposes of rules and effects. • A card with a yellow color strip is considered yellow for the purposes of rules and effects. • A card with a blue color strip is considered blue for the purposes of rules and effects.
2.1.3.	If the base pitch or pitch of a card is modified, it does not modify the color strip of the card.
2.2.	Cost
2.2.1.	Cost is a numeric property of a card or ability, which determines the starting resource asset-cost to play the card or activate the ability. (See Rule 5.1.6)
2.2.2.	The printed cost of a card is typically expressed within a resource point symbol located in the top right corner of the card. The printed cost defines the base cost of a card. If a card does not have a printed cost, it does not have the cost property (0 is a valid printed cost).
2.2.2a	If the printed value is expressed as two or more undefined symbols and/or numeric values, they are additive for determining the base cost of a card. Example: Spark of Genius has the cost property with the printed value of “XX”, which determines the base cost as X + X for any value of X.
2.2.3.	The printed cost of an activated ability is expressed as {r} symbols as part of the description of the ability, where the number of {r} symbols dictates the printed cost. If there are no resource symbols, then the printed cost is 0. The printed cost defines the base resource cost of the ability. (See Rule 5.2.1)
2.2.4.	The cost property of an object cannot be modified.
2.2.4a	An effect that increases or reduces the cost of an object does not modify the cost property of that object. Effects that modify cost are only applied as part of the process for playing or activating that object. (See Rule 5.1.6) Example: An effect that reduces the cost to play a card does not change the cost property of that card in any way - it only changes the calculation of the resource cost when that card is being played.
2.2.4b	An effect that refers to the cost of an object refers to the unmodified cost property of an object. An Effect that refers to the payment of an object, refers to the modified cost of an object when it was paid to play/activate and put that object on the stack.
2.2.5.	The visual expression in {r} symbols and the numerical expression of cost are functionally identical. Example: The text “Search your deck for a card with cost value 1”, is considered to be the same as the text “Search your deck for a card with cost value {r}.”
2.3.	Defense
2.3.1.	Defense is a numeric property of an object, which represents the value contributed to the total sum of defense used in the damage step of combat. (See Section 7.5 - Damage Step)
2.3.2.	The printed defense of a card is typically located at the bottom right corner of a card next to the {d} symbol. The printed defense defines the base defense of a card. If a card does not have a printed defense, it does not have the defense property (0 is a valid printed defense).
2.3.2a	If the defense of a card is represented as a (*), then the card has an ability that defines the defense of the card at any point in or out of the game. If the ability requires a number that can not be determined, the defense of the card is 0.
2.3.3.	The defense of an object can be modified. The term “defense” or the symbol {d} refers to the modified defense of an object.
2.4.	Intellect
2.4.1.	Intellect is a numeric property of a hero card, which represents the number of cards the controlling player draws up to at the end of their turn. (See Section 4.4 - End Phase)
2.4.2.	The printed intellect of a card is typically located at the bottom left corner of a card next to the {i} symbol. The printed intellect defines the base intellect of a card. If a card does not have a printed intellect, it does not have the intellect property (0 is a valid printed intellect).
2.4.3.	The intellect of an object can be modified. The term “intellect” or the symbol {i} refers to the modified intellect of an object.
2.5.	Life
2.5.1.	Life is a numeric property of an object, which represents the starting life total of that object. An object with the life property is a living object.
2.5.2.	The printed life of a card is typically located at the bottom right corner of a card next to the {h} symbol. The printed life defines the base life of a card. If a card does not have a printed life, it does not have the life property (0 is a valid printed life).
2.5.3.	The life of an object can be modified. The term “life total” or the symbol {h} refers to the modified life of an object.
2.5.3a	An object’s life total is equal to the object’s base life, plus life gained and minus life lost, as recorded by the players of the game.
2.5.3b	Life gained and life lost are not continuous effects - they are discrete effects that apply once, and they permanently modify the life total. (See Rule 8.5.8)
2.5.3c	If the base life of an object changes, then the life total is recalculated using the new base life value of the object. Example: Shiyana has 20 base life and the text “[...] Shiyana becomes a copy of target hero [...]”. If Shiyana has lost 5 life and copies the target hero is Kano, with 15 base life, the new life total for Shiyana is 10.
2.5.3d	An object’s life total can be greater than its base life.
2.5.3e	An object can not have a negative life total. If life loss would reduce an object’s life total to less than zero, instead it reduces it to zero.
2.5.3f	If a living object’s life total is reduced to zero, it is cleared as a game state action; or if the living object is a hero, their player loses or the game is a draw as a game state action. (See Rule 1.10.2	and Section 4.5 - Ending a Game)
2.5.3g	If a living object ceases to exist, it is considered to have died.
2.6.	Name
2.6.1.	Name is a property of an object, which represents one of its object identities and determines the object’s uniqueness (along with the pitch property). (See Rule 1.2.4	and Rule 1.3.2)
2.6.2.	The printed name of a card is typically located at the top of the card. The printed name defines the name of a card.
2.6.3.	If an object has a name that is a personal name, that name determines the object’s moniker - the most significant identifier of the object’s name. A personal name is typically written in the format “[HONORIFIC?] [MONIKER] [LAST?] [, SUFFIX?]”, where HONORIFIC (if any) is one or more name honorifics, MONIKER is the moniker of the name, LAST (if any) is one or more middle and/or last names, and SUFFIX (if any) is a title or nickname written after a comma. Example: The monikers of these names are as follows: Bravo (Bravo), Dorinthea Ironsong (Dorinthea), Data Doll MKII (Data Doll), Ser Boltyn, Breaker of Dawn (Boltyn), Blasmophet, the Soul Harvester, (Blasmophet), The Librarian (The Librarian), Dawnblade (Dawnblade), Stalagmite, Bastion of Isenloft (Stalagmite).
2.6.3a	If an object does not have a name that is a personal name, it does not have a moniker.
2.6.3b	If two objects have different names, they may have the same moniker. An effect that refers to an object using a moniker, may refer to two or more objects with different names but the same moniker. Example: The cards “Bravo”, “Bravo, Showstopper”, and “Bravo, Star of the Show”, all have the moniker “Bravo”.
2.6.4.	An object’s printed name is always considered to be the English language version of its name, regardless of the printed language.
2.7.	Pitch
2.7.1.	Pitch is a numeric property of a card, which represents the number of resources the card generates when it is pitched and determines the object’s uniqueness (along with the name property). (See Rule 1.14.2a	and Rule 1.3.2)
2.7.2.	The printed pitch of a card is expressed visually as one, two, or three socketed {r} symbols, typically located in the top left corner of a card, where the number of {r} symbols dictates the printed pitch. The printed pitch defines the base pitch of a card. If a card does not have a printed pitch, it does not have the pitch property.
2.7.3.	The pitch of an object can be modified. The term “pitch” refers to the modified pitch of an object.
2.7.4.	The visual expression in {r} symbols and the numerical expression of pitch are functionally identical. Example: The text “Search your deck for a card with pitch value 1”, is considered to be the same as the text “Search your deck for a card with pitch value {r}.”
2.8.	Power
2.8.1.	Power is a numeric property of an object, which represents the power value used in the damage step of combat. (See Section 7.5 - Damage Step)
2.8.2.	The printed power of a card is typically located at the bottom left corner of a card next to the {p} symbol. The printed power defines the base power of a card. If a card does not have a printed power, it does not have the power property (0 is a valid printed power).
2.8.2a	If the power value of a card is represented as a (*)then the card has an ability that defines the base power of the card at any point in or out of the game. If the ability requires a number that can not be determined, the power of the card is 0.
2.8.3.	The power of an object can be modified. The term “power” or the symbol {p} refers to the modified power of an object.
2.9.	Subtypes
2.9.1.	Subtypes are a collection of subtype keywords.
2.9.2.	An object can have zero or more subtypes.
2.9.3.	The subtypes of a card are determined by its type box. Subtypes (if any) are printed after a long dash after the card’s type.
2.9.4.	The subtypes of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the subtypes of its source.
2.9.5.	An object can gain or lose subtypes from rules and/or effects.
2.9.6.	Subtypes are either functional or non-functional keywords. Functional subtypes add additional rules to an object. Non-functional subtypes do not add additional rules to an object.
2.9.6a	The functional subtype keywords are (1H), (2H), Affliction, Ally, Arrow, Attack, Aura, Invocation, Item, Landmark, and Trap. (See Section 8.2 - Subtype Keywords)
2.9.6b	The non-functional subtypes keywords are Arms, Ash, Axe, Bow, Chest, Claw, Club, Dagger, Demon, Dragon, Flail, Gem, Gun, Hammer, Head, Legs, Off-hand, Orb, Pistol, Scepter, Scythe, Staff, Sword, and Young.
2.10.	Supertypes
2.10.1.	Supertypes are a collection of supertype keywords.
2.10.2.	An object can have zero or more supertypes.
2.10.3.	The supertypes of a card are determined by its type box. Supertypes are printed before the card’s type.
2.10.4.	The supertypes of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the supertypes of its source.
2.10.5.	An object can gain or lose supertypes from rules and/or effects.
2.10.6.	Supertypes are non-functional keywords and do not add additional rules to an object. A supertype is either a class or a talent.
2.10.6a	The class supertype keywords are Brute, Guardian, Illusionist, Mechanologist, Merchant, Ninja, Ranger, Runeblade, Shapeshifter, Warrior, and Wizard.
2.10.6b	The talent supertype keywords are Draconic, Earth, Elemental, Ice, Light, Lightning, and Shadow.
2.11.	Text Box
2.11.1.	The text box of a card contains the card text of a card, typically located on the lower half of a card beneath the illustration.
2.11.2.	The card text of a card contains the rules text, reminder text, and flavor text of the card (if any). Rules text is printed in roman and boldface. Reminder text is printed in parenthesized italics. Flavor text is separated vertically from the rules and reminder text (if any) by a horizontal bar and is printed in italics.
2.11.3.	The rules text of a card defines the base abilities of the card. A paragraph of rules text typically defines a single ability. Reminder and flavor text do not affect the game.
2.11.4.	The rules text of a card is always considered to be the official rules text on the most recent English printed version of a card unless a card has received errata. If a card has received a functional errata, it will be announced in this document or in an errata bulletin at http://fabtcg.com/errata. The official card text will be updated to match the errata.
2.11.5.	If rules text specifies the name and/or moniker of its source object in the third person, it can be interpreted “this” refers to its source object and not other cards with the same name, unless it explicitly states otherwise.
2.11.5a	If an ability is otherwise gained by an object, and the rules text that defines that ability includes references to its source object by name/moniker, the gained ability refers to its current source. Example: Fractal Replication has the text “When you play or defend with Fractal Replication, it gains the base abilities of all Illusionist attack action cards on the combat chain.”. If Fractal Replication gains the ability “If Wartune Herald hits, put it into your hero’s soul.” from a card called Wartune Herald, the gained ability now refers to Fractal Replication and can be read as “If Fractal Replication hits, put it into your hero’s soul.”
2.11.6.	If rules text specifies the name and/or moniker of a card that is not its source object, it refers to any object with that name and/or moniker.
2.12.	Type Box
2.12.1.	The type box of a card determines the card’s type, supertype(s) (if any), and subtype(s) (if any), typically located at the bottom of the card. Type boxes are typically written in the format “[SUPERTYPES] [TYPE] [— SUBTYPES?]”, where SUPERTYPES is one or more supertypes, TYPE is a type, and SUBTYPES (if any) is one or more subtypes.
2.12.1a	If the SUPERTYPES of a type box is “Generic”, the card has no supertypes.
2.13.	Types
2.13.1.	An object can have zero or more types.
2.13.2.	The type of a card is determined by its type box. The type is printed after the card’s supertypes, and before a long dash and subtypes (if any).
2.13.3.	The types of an activated-layer or triggered-layer are the same as the types of its source.
2.13.3a	The types of an activated ability layer include the types determined by the activated ability. (See Rule 5.2.1)
2.13.4.	An object can gain or lose types from rules and/or effects.
2.13.5.	Types are functional keywords and add additional rules to an object.
2.13.5a	The type keywords are Action, Attack Reaction, Defense Reaction, Equipment, Hero, Instant, Mentor, Resource, and Weapon. (See Section 8.1 - Type Keywords)
3.	Zones
3.0.	General
3.0.1.	A zone is a collection of objects and has a physical position in the play-space. There are 15 types of zones: arms, arsenal, banished, chest, combat chain, deck, graveyard, hand, head, hero, legs, permanent, pitch, stack, and weapon.
3.0.1a	A zone is considered empty when it does not contain any objects. A zone does not cease to exist if it is empty.
3.0.2.	Each player has their own arms, arsenal, banished, chest, deck, graveyard, hand, head, hero, legs, and pitch zones; and has two weapon zones. The stack zone, permanent zone, and combat chain zone are shared by all players. Note: Cards printed before 2023 have used the phrase “zone you control” which refers to a zone that the player owns.
3.0.3.	A public object is an object where the information about the properties of the object is currently available to all players. A private object is an object where the information about the properties of that object is not currently available to all players.
3.0.3a	A player may look at any private object that is in a zone that they own, except the deck zone.
3.0.4.	Public zones are zones in which the objects in that zone are public. Private zones are zones in which the objects in that zone are private.
3.0.4a	The arms, banished, chest, combat chain, graveyard, head, hero, legs, permanent, pitch, stack, and weapon zones are public zones.
3.0.4b	The arsenal, deck, and hand zones are private zones.
3.0.4c	A public zone can contain a private object, if the object is made private while in that zone, or if the object is moved into that zone as a private object. The private object remains private until a rule or effect makes it public.
3.0.4d	A private zone can contain public objects, if the object is made public while in that zone, or if the object is moved into that zone as a public object. The public object remains public until a rule or effect makes it private.
3.0.5.	The arena is a collection of all the arms, chest, combat chain, head, hero, legs, permanent, and weapon zones.
3.0.5a	The arena is not a zone. If an object would be put into the arena by a rule or effect without specifying a zone, it is placed into the permanent zone as a permanent.
3.0.5b	The arsenal, banished, deck, graveyard, hand, pitch, and stack zones are not part of the arena.
3.0.6.	The position of each player’s zones is shown by Figure 3.1.	Head, chest, arms, and legs zones are on the left; with the head zone directly above, arms zone directly right, and legs zone directly below, the chest zone. Hero, weapon, and arsenal zones are in the center; with the two weapon zones both directly left and right, and the arsenal zone directly below, the hero zone. Graveyard, pitch, deck, and banished zones are on the right; with the graveyard zone directly above, the pitch zone directly left, and the banished zone directly below, the deck zone.
3.0.6a	A player may swap the positions of their zones by mirroring the layout. That is; a player may swap the position of the head and graveyard zones, chest and deck zones, arms and pitch zones, and legs and banished zones.
3.0.6b	A player’s hand zone does not have a specified location; it is instead held by the player.
3.0.6c	The permanent and stack zones do not have a specified location; objects in these zones can be represented anywhere on the game space except any other zone.
3.0.6d	If an additional zone of an existing type and ownership is created by a rule or effect, the zone is positioned adjacent to the existing zones of the same type and ownership.
3.0.7.	When an object moves from one zone to another, the object leaving its old zone (origin) and the object entering its new zone (destination) is performed simultaneously. At no point is the object not in a zone.
3.0.7a	The object as it leaves the origin is considered the object moving for rules and effects. If the object is private when it moves zones, it is considered to have no properties for effects. Example: Levia has the text “While a card with 6 or more {p} has been put into your banished zone this turn, [...]”, which is a while-conditional static effect. If a card is banished and it has 4 {p} as it leaves its origin, but 6 {p} when it enters the banished zone, it does not meet the condition of the effect. If a card is banished and it is private as it leaves its origin, it does not meet the condition of the effect.
3.0.7b	If the origin and the destination of a move are the same, then no move occurs. If the object would go from public to private during the move, it just becomes private instead. If the object would go from private to public during the move, it just becomes public instead.
3.0.8.	If a private object will move zones and be public at the destination, it becomes public before it is moved. If a public object will move zones and be private at the destination, it becomes private before it is moved. Example: Azalea’s activated ability puts a card from the deck (private object) into the arsenal face up (public object in a private zone), therefore it becomes public before it is moved. Example: Intimidate puts a card from hand (private object) into the banished zone face down (private object in a public zone), therefore it does not become public before it is moved.
3.0.8a	If the destination of an object is replaced after the object becomes public, then Rule 3.0.8	is re- evaluated based on whether it will be a public or private object at the new destination. Example: Drone of Brutality has the text “If Drone of Brutality would be put into your graveyard from anywhere, instead put it on the bottom of your deck.”. If Drone of Brutality is discarded (from the private hand zone to the public graveyard zone), the card first becomes a public object, then the replacement effect replaces the destination to be the deck (a private zone), the card becomes a private object, and finally, the cards are moved to the bottom of the deck.
3.0.9.	If an object that enters a zone that is not in the arena and is not the stack zone, or a public object becomes a private object, it becomes a new object and has no relation to its previous existence. Example: Endless Arrow is played and during the reaction step, Snapdragon Scalers is activated to give it “go again”. Endless Arrow hits and returns to the player’s hand (a zone outside the arena) and therefore becomes a new object. If the player plays Endless Arrow again it will not have “go again” because it is a new Endless Arrow card with no relation to its previous existence.
3.0.9a	An ability that triggers when an object moves from one zone to another still references the new object, as long as the object remains a  public object. Example: Merciful Retribution has the text “Whenever an aura or attack action card you control is destroyed, [...] If it’s a non-token Light card, put it into your hero’s soul.”. If a non-token Light card in the arena is destroyed, it moves to the graveyard and becomes a new object. However, because Merciful Retribution triggers on the object moving to the graveyard (as part of its destruction) it still references the new object it becomes in that zone for the triggered-layer it produces. If the non-token Light card moves to another zone or becomes private before the layer resolves, the triggered-layer loses that reference.
3.0.9b	An ability with an effect that moves an object from one zone to another still references the new object for the remainder of any effects it generates, as long as the object remains a public object. Example: Bull’s Eye Bracers has the text “If you have no cards in your arsenal, you may put an arrow card from your hand face up into your arsenal. If gains +1{p} until end of turn.”. If an arrow card is put into the arsenal, it becomes a new object. However, because the activated ability of Bull’s Eye Bracers was the source of the effect that moved the arrow card, the rest of the effec
3.0.10.	Zones of the same type are independent of their creation method. If a rule or effect creates a zone of same type as an existing zone, the created zone is not distinguishable as being created by that rule or effect - only that there is now an additional zone of that type.
3.0.10a	If a rule or effect moves an object into a specified type of zone, and there are two or more zones that match the specified type, the player that owns the object chooses which zone that object is moved to.
3.0.10b	If the zone of a player ceases to exist, and there is only one of that type of zone owned by the player, any cards in that zone are cleared and the zone ceases to exist.
3.0.10c	If the zone of a player ceases to exist, and there are two or more of that type of zone owned by the player, an empty zone of that type owned by the player ceases to exist. If there are no zones of that type owned by the player that are empty, the player chooses which zone will cease to exist - any cards in that zone are cleared and the zone ceases to exist.
3.0.11.	If a rule will move an object to a zone that does not exist, or the zone can not contain that object, the object is moved to the graveyard instead. If an effect would move an object to a zone that does not exist, or the zone can not contain that object, that effect simply fails.
3.0.12.	To clear an object, move it from its current zone to its owner’s graveyard.
3.0.12a	If the object is a token or a non-card-layer, it leaves its current zone and simply ceases to exist.
3.0.13.	If an effect refers to one or more zones without specifying the owner of those zones (or specifying “any”), it refers to the zones owned by the controller of the effect.
3.0.14.	A sub-object is a card or token that is under a permanent. A top-object is the permanent the sub-object is underneath.
3.0.14a	A card or token is only considered to be under a permanent if specified by an effect.
3.0.14b	A sub-object is not considered to be in the arena, even if its top-object is in the arena.
3.0.14c	If a top-object moves zones and remains the same object, its subobjects move to the same zone as part of the same event and remain subobjects.
3.0.14d	If the top-object is public, all sub-objects are also public. If a top-object is private, all sub-objects are also private. Figure 3.1: The official layout of a player’s zones from the perspective of the player looking down. The combat chain zone is shared by all players. A player’s hand zone is held by the player. The permanent and stack zones do not have a specified location.
3.0.14e	If a top-object ceases to exist, its sub-objects are cleared as part of the same event. (See Rule 3.0.12)
3.1.	Arms
3.1.1.	An arms zone is a public zone in the arena, owned by a player.
3.1.2.	An arms zone can only contain up to one object, with the subtype arms.
3.1.3.	A player may start the game with a card (with the subtype arms) as a permanent in their arms zone. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a Game)
3.2.	Arsenal
3.2.1.	An arsenal zone is a private zone outside the arena, owned by a player.
3.2.2.	An arsenal zone can only contain up to one card, that started in the owner’s starting deck.
3.2.2a	If an effect would put a card into an arsenal zone that is not empty, or into the arsenal and there are no empty arsenal zones, that effect fails.
3.2.3.	The term “arsenal” refers to all arsenal zones owned by a player and the cards in those zones.
3.2.3a	A player’s arsenal is considered empty if all of their arsenal zones are empty.
3.2.3b	If a rule or effect would specify a card to move into a player’s arsenal, it is moved into one of their empty arsenal zones.
3.2.4.	Cards in an arsenal zone may be played. (See Section 5.1 - Playing Cards)
3.3.	Banished
3.3.1.	A banished zone is a public zone outside the arena, owned by a player.

3.5.	Combat Chain
3.5.1.	The combat chain zone is a public zone in the arena. There is only one combat chain zone, shared by all players, and it does not have an owner.
3.5.2.	The term “combat chain” refers to the combat chain zone.
3.5.3.	The combat chain is “open” during combat - otherwise it is “closed”. (See Chapter 7 - Combat)
3.5.4.	A chain link is an element of a sequence of attacks on the combat chain. A chain link is represented by an attack. A combat chain has zero or more chain links.
3.5.4a	If an attack is added onto the combat chain as a chain link, it becomes chain link N + 1, where N is the number of existing chain links on the combat chain. Chain link N (if any) becomes the “previous chain link” and chain link N + 1 becomes the “current chain link”, until the combat chain closes.
3.5.4b	If an attack that represents a chain link ceases to exist, or ceases to represent the chain link, the chain link itself continues to exist, and rules and effects use the last known information about the attack. (See Rule 1.2.5) Example: If a Dawnblade represents chain link 1 as an attack on the combat chain, and then is attacked with again and becomes chain link 2 on the same combat chain; the Dawnblade ceases to represent chain link 1 but it will continue to exist and Last Known information about the Dawnblade as an attack are used for rules and effects that specifically refer to that chain link or attack.
3.5.4c	A chain link and objects on a chain link are considered to be in the arena. Abilities of a chain link and objects on a chain link are typically considered functional with the exception of non-permanent defending objects (see Rule 1.7.5	and Rule 3.5.4d).
3.5.4d	Defending objects are objects that are designated to be defending by a rule or effect (see Rule 7.3.2	and Rule 7.4.2d). Defending objects on a chain link are considered to be defending that chain link until they leave the combat chain. Defending objects are placed on the chain link of the attack they are defending and remain there until the combat chain closes.
3.5.4e	The controller of a chain link is the same as the attack that represents it.
3.5.4f	The owner of a chain link is the same as the attack that represents it.
3.6.	Deck
3.6.1.	A deck zone is a private zone outside the arena, owned by a player.
3.6.2.	A deck zone can only contain cards that started in the owner’s starting deck.
3.6.3.	The term “deck” refers to the deck zone.
3.6.4.	A player can not look at objects in their own deck zone unless specified by a rule or effect. 3.6.5.	Objects in the deck zone are placed face down in an ordered uniform pile.
3.6.6.	A player’s starting deck starts the game in their deck zone. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a Game)

3.14.3.	The stack contains an ordered collection of layers. (See Section 1.6 - Layers)
3.14.4.	When a layer is added onto the stack, it becomes layer N + 1 where N is the number of existing layers on the stack.
3.14.5.	The top layer of the stack is layer N , with the highest value of N .
3.14.6.	When a layer N is removed from the stack by a rule or effect, any layer M where M > N becomes layer M − 1. Example: There are 4 layers on the stack. Layer 2 is an instant card and is removed by a “negate” effect. Layer 3 becomes layer 2, and layer 4 becomes layer 3, while layer 1 remains unchanged.

4.	Game Structure
4.0.	General
4.0.1.	A game of Flesh and Blood starts with the players executing the start of game procedure and ends when a player wins, or the game is a draw. (See Section 4.1 - Starting a Game and Section 4.5 - Ending a Game)
4.0.2.	A match consists of one or more consecutive games between the same players with the same decks.
4.0.3.	A turn is a game state concept that structures the order of play and phases.
4.0.3a	A turn consists of 3 phases in order: Start Phase, Action Phase, and End Phase.
4.0.3b	Only one player can have a turn at any point in time. A player whose turn it is is the “turn player”. A player whose turn it is not is a “non-turn player”.
4.1.	Starting a Game
4.1.1.	The process of starting a game is referred to as the “Start of Game Procedure”
4.1.2.	First, each player places their hero card face up in their hero zone.
4.1.3.	Second, a player is selected and chooses the first turn player. If it is the first game of a match, one of the players is selected using a random method that is mutually agreeable. If it is not the first game of a match, the player who lost first in the previous game of the match is the selected player; or if the previous game ended in a draw, the selected player is the same as in the previous game. The select player then chooses any player to be the first turn player.
4.1.4.	Third, each player selects equipment and/or weapon cards from their deck that they will start the game with.
4.1.4a	A player may select up to one card for each of their arms, chest, head, legs, and weapon zones. Each card will start the game in their respective zone, based on their type and/or subtype.
4.1.4b	Cards selected this way are placed face down in their respective zones or in a single face down pile next to the hero.
4.1.5.	Fourth, each player selects the cards from their deck that will become their starting deck.
4.1.5a	Equipment and weapon cards can not be included in a player’s starting deck.
4.1.5b	If a meta-static ability effect allows the player to start the game with one or more cards in a zone other than the deck zone, these cards are selected from their starting deck and placed face down in their respective zones or in the single face down pile next to the hero. The cards selected this way are still considered part of the player’s starting deck. Example: Dash has the text “You may start the game with a Mechanologist item with cost {r}{r} or less in the arena.”, which means if the game format requires a starting deck of 40 cards, the player may select the specified from those 40 cards, and start the game with 1 card in the arena and 39 cards in their deck zone.
4.1.6.	Fifth, all other cards that are not selected from a player’s deck during Rule 4.1.4	or Rule 4.1.5	become that player’s sideboard.
4.1.6a	An sideboard is a defined collection of cards - it is not a zone.
4.1.6b	An sideboard is private to each player. Players may look at their own sideboard during a game and are not required to show any other player.
4.1.7.	Sixth, each player shuffles and presents their starting deck to an opponent to be shuffled and/or cut. 4.1.7a	After a player has presented their starting deck to be shuffled and/or cut, it is placed in their deck zone and they may no longer change any cards they have chosen in Rule 4.1.4	and Rule 4.1.5.	4.1.7b	A starting deck is private to each player. The opponent may not look at the information of the cards in a deck presented to them.
4.1.8.	Seventh, each player reveals their weapons, equipment, and any other cards that start the game in a zone other than the deck zone, and places them face up in their respective zones.
4.1.9.	Eighth and finally, each player draws cards up to their hero’s intellect and the first turn player begins their Start Phase.
4.2.	Start Phase
4.2.1.	Players do not get priority during the Start Phase.
4.2.2.	First, the turn starts. Effects that last until the “start of turn” end. The “start of turn” event occurs and abilities that trigger at the start of turn are triggered. Layers on the stack resolve and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players are passing priority in succession.
4.2.3.	Second and finally, when the stack is empty, the Start Phase ends and the game proceeds to the action phase.
4.3.	Action Phase
4.3.1.	First, the action phase starts. The “beginning of the action phase” event occurs and abilities that trigger at the beginning of the action phase are triggered.
4.3.2.	Second, the turn player has 1 action point.
4.3.2a	Abilities that trigger when a player gains an action point do not trigger when the turn player gains an action point this way.
4.3.2b	Replacement effects that modify events when a player gains an action point do not modify or replace when the turn player gains an action point this way.
4.3.3.	Third, the turn player gains priority.
4.3.4.	Fourth and finally, when the stack is empty, the combat chain is closed, and both players pass priority in succession, the action phase ends and the game proceeds to the End Phase.
4.4.	End Phase
4.4.1.	Players do not get priority during the End Phase.
4.4.2.	First, the “beginning of the end phase” event occurs and abilities that trigger at the beginning of the end phase are triggered. Layers on the stack resolve and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players are passing priority in succession.
4.4.3.	Second, when the stack is empty, the end of turn procedure occurs. After each step in the end of turn procedure, if a triggered effect has triggered, the triggered-layers are added to the stack; then layers on the stack resolve, and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players are passing priority in succession. The end of turn procedure happens in the following order:
4.4.3a	All allies’ life totals are reset to their base life, modified by any counters on the object.
4.4.3b	The turn player may put a card from their hand face down into an empty arsenal zone they own.
4.4.3c	Each player puts all cards in their pitch zone (if any) on the bottom of their deck in any order. The order cards are put on the bottom of the deck this way is hidden information.
4.4.3d	All players lose all action points and resources.
4.4.3e	The turn player draws cards until the number of cards in their hand is equal to their hero’s intellect {i}. If it is the first turn of the game, all other players draw cards until the number of cards in their hand is equal to their hero’s intellect {i}. If a player already has at least that many cards in their hand, they do not draw any cards this way. (See Rule 8.5.6)
4.4.4.	Third and finally, the turn ends. Effects that last until the “until end of turn” and “this turn” end. The next player in clockwise order becomes the new turn player (see Rule 1.1.6). The new turn player begins their Start Phase.
4.5.	Ending a Game
4.5.1.	A game ends immediately when a player wins, or the game is a draw.
4.5.2.	A player can win the game in the following ways:
4.5.2a	A player wins the game if all of their opponents have lost the game.
4.5.2b	A player wins the game if an effect states that they win the game.
4.5.3.	A player can lose the game in the following ways:
4.5.3a	A player loses the game if their hero’s life total is reduced to zero.
4.5.3b	A player loses the game if an effect states that they lose the game.
4.5.3c	A player loses the game if they concede.
4.5.4.	The game can be a draw for the remaining players in the following ways:
4.5.4a	The game is a draw for the remaining players if all remaining players’ hero’s life totals are simultaneously reduced to zero. Example: There are 2 remaining players. One player plays and resolves Forked Lightning, targeting both themselves and their opponent. Neither player prevents any arcane damage and both their life totals are simultaneously reduced to zero, resulting in a draw.
4.5.4b	The game is a draw for the remaining players if an effect states that the game is a draw.
4.5.4c	The game is a draw for the remaining players if all remaining players agree to an intentional draw. The remaining players can agree to a draw at any time.
4.5.4d	The game is a draw for the remaining players if a stalemate occurs. A stalemate happens when no remaining player can legally advance the game state toward ending the game. Example: There are 2 remaining players. Both players only have a Cracked Bauble in their hand, no cards in the arena, or cards in their deck, arsenal, or banished zone. Both players control a weapon without an attack ability or an ability that would reduce life totals, so they have no way of advancing the game state to a conclusion. Therefore the game ends in a draw because both players are stalemated.
4.5.4e	The game is a draw for the remaining players if a deadlock occurs. A deadlock happens when all remaining players refuse to legally advance the game state toward ending the game. Example: There are 2 remaining players on 1 life total. Both players only have Invert Existence and a Cracked Bauble in their hand, no equipment, weapon, or cards in their deck, arsenal, or banished zone. The first person to play Invert Existence will lose the game because the opposing player can respond with their Invert Existence which will resolve first and give them the win. Therefore the game ends in a draw because both players are deadlocked.
5.	Layers, Cards, & Abilities
5.0.	General
5.1.	Playing Cards
5.1.1.	To play a card, move it from its current zone to the stack zone to become a card layer on the stack. Playing a card involves the following steps in order: Announce, Declare Costs, Declare Modes and Targets, Check Legal Play, Calculate Asset-Costs, Pay Asset-Costs, Calculate Effect-Costs, Pay Effect-Costs, and Play.
5.1.1a	A player can only play cards from their hand or arsenal zones.
5.1.2.	Announce: First, the player proposes the card to be played. The card moves to the stack zone under that player’s control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack.
5.1.2a	Delayed continuous effects that apply to the next card played are applied if the card matches the effect description. Example: There are three continuous effects active: “The next attack action card you play gains +3{p}.”, “Action cards cost {r} less to play.”, and “Attacks you control have +3{p}”. When an attack action card is proposed to be played and is moved to the stack under the player’s control, all three effects begin to apply immediately.
5.1.3.	Declare Costs: Second, the player declares the parameters for any costs of the proposed card. 5.1.3a	If the card has a variable cost (the cost includes X), the player must declare the value of X (see Rule 1.12.2).
5.1.3b	If the card has additional costs that are optional, the player must declare all additional costs that will be paid.
5.1.3c	If the card has an alternative cost, the player must declare if the alternative cost will be paid. If a card has multiple alternative costs, the player may only select a single alternative cost (if any) to be paid.
5.1.3d	If the card has the type action and it may be played as an instant, the player declares whether or not they are playing the card as an instant.
5.1.3e	If there are two or more effect-costs to be paid, the player declares the order those costs will be paid.
5.1.4.	Declare Modes and Targets: Third, the player declares the parameters of all resolution abilities.
5.1.4a	If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must declare the modes for those abilities (see Rule 1.7.6). Then, if any resolution abilities generate effects that require a target, the player must declare all legal targets for those effects Rule 1.8.4.
5.1.4b	If the card is an attack, the player must declare any additional parameters of the attack (see Rule 7.0.5).
5.1.5.	Check Legal Play: Fourth, the card is evaluated if it is legal to play before any costs are paid. If a rule or effect prevents the card from being played, or the parameters of the proposed card are illegal, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card was announced. (See Section 1.10.3	- Game State)
5.1.6.	Calculate Asset-Costs: Fifth, all asset-costs of the proposed card are calculated. (See Section 1.13 - Assets)
5.1.6a	First, rules define the starting asset-cost. Second, effects that set an asset-cost are applied. Third, effects that increase an asset-cost are applied. Fourth and finally, effects that reduce an asset-cost are applied - if an effect would reduce an asset-cost to be less than zero, it instead reduces it to zero. If two or more effects are applied at each step, then they are applied in timestamp order Rule 6.3.4.
5.1.6b	The action asset-cost starts at zero. If the card has the type action and is not played as an instant, the action cost starts at one instead.
5.1.6c	The resource asset-cost starts at the base resource cost of a card being played. If an alternative cost is declared that replaces the resource asset-cost for playing the card, then the resource asset-cost starts at zero instead.
5.1.7.	Pay Asset-Costs: Sixth, the player pays all asset-costs (if any) (see Rule 1.14.2a).
5.1.7a	If any asset-cost is not paid in full, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card is announced. (See Section 1.10.3	- Game State)
5.1.8.	Calculate Effect-Costs: Seventh, all effect-costs of the proposed cards are calculated.
5.1.8a	If any effect-cost can not be paid, based on the order declared by the player, the card is illegal to play and the game state is reversed to before the card was announced. (See Section 1.10.3	- Game State)
5.1.9.	Pay Effect-Costs: Eighth, the player pays all effect-costs.
5.1.9a	If a replacement effect modifies an effect-cost, and that cost cannot be paid (the effect does not resolve successfully), the card can still be played.
5.1.10.	Play: Ninth and finally, the card is now considered played and the player regains priority.
5.2.	Activated Abilities
5.2.1.	An activated ability is an ability that can be activated to put an activated-layer on the stack. Activated abilities are always written in the format “[LIMIT?] [TYPE] — [COST]: [ABILITIES] [CONDITION?]”.
5.2.1a	The LIMIT (if any) is written at the start of the ability and specifies the maximum number of times the ability can be activated. If there is no limit, the ability can be activated any number of times.
5.2.1b	The TYPE is written directly before the hyphen and specifies the type of the ability and the type of the activated-layer created by activating the ability.
5.2.1c	The COST is written between the dash and colon. It specifies the cost to be paid to activate the ability. A cost of “0” specifies the resource cost to activate the ability is zero.
5.2.1d	The ABILITIES are written after the colon and specify the base abilities of the activated-layer. When the activated-layer resolves, the resolution abilities of the layer generate effects.
5.2.1e	The CONDITION (if any) is written at the end of the ability and specifies the activation condition. If the activated ability has an activation condition and that condition is not met, the ability can not be activated.
5.2.2.	To activate an activated ability is to create an activated-layer on the stack. Only an object’s controller can activate its activated ability unless specified by a rule or effect. Activating an activated ability involves the following:
5.2.2a	Announce the activated ability to be activated. The activated-layer is created in the stack zone under that player’s control and becomes the topmost layer of the stack. The activated-layer is created with the same supertypes and types as the source of the activated ability. Continuous effects begin to apply to the ability layer.
5.2.2b	The remainder of the process for activating an activated ability is identical to the process for playing a card listed in steps 5.1.3-5.1.10, substituting “play” for ‘activate‘, and “card” for “ability”.
5.2.3.	If an effect allows a source to be activated additional times, the activated ability on the source may be activated to exceed its LIMIT that many times.
5.2.3a	If an effect allows a source to be activated additional times, and it has multiple activated abilities, the player instructed by the effect selects which of those abilities the effect applies to the time the ability is activated beyond its LIMIT.
5.2.3b	If an effect allows a source to attack additional times, it refers to activating an ability on the source with the attack effect. Example: Twinning Blade has the text “You may attack an additional time with target sword this turn.”, which allows the player to activate an activated ability (with the attack effect) on the target sword an additional time past its LIMIT.
5.2.3c	Effects that allow the additional activation of an activated ability are additive. Effects that state how many times an ability can be activated in total, set the LIMIT of the activated ability (or the total number of times that all activated abilities), which can be increased by effects that allow the additional activation of an ability. Example: Blood on Her Hands has the text “[...] Target 1H weapon may attack twice this turn.”, which is an effect that sets the total number of times an activated ability (with the attack effect) can be activated on the target to two. If this effect is applied two or more times, the activated ability (with the attack effect) can still only be activated twice.
5.2.4.	A hidden activated ability (HAA) is an activated ability that is functional when its source is a private object (and not in the deck zone). A hidden activated ability is typically written in the format “[LIMIT?] [TYPE] — [COST]: [ABILITIES] [CONDITION]”, where the CONDITION specifies the privacy status and/or zone of the object for the ability to be functional.
5.2.4a	When the activation condition for a hidden activated ability is met and the owner has priority, the owner may activate the ability. If they do, the source of the ability becomes public and remains public until the activated-layer resolves or otherwise ceases to exist. When an object becomes public this way, it does not trigger any abilities and can not be replaced by any replacement effects.
5.3.	Resolution Abilities & Resolving Layers
5.3.1.	A resolution ability is an ability that generates effects when its source resolves as a layer on the stack.
5.3.2.	If the stack is not empty and all players pass in succession, the top layer of the stack resolves (with the exception of the Layer step of combat Section 7.1 - Layer Step). When a layer successfully resolves, the resolution abilities of that layer generate their effects.
5.3.2a	If a layer fails to resolve, the resolution abilities of that layer do not generate their effects.
5.3.2b	If the parameters of any effects of a resolution ability are undetermined, those parameters are determined before those effects are generated. (See Rule 1.8.5)
5.3.2c	If the resolution of a layer generates multiple effects, effects are generated immediately and in the order specified by the resolution abilities. If any generated effect fails, the remaining effects continue to be generated.
5.3.3.	A layer can fail to resolve in the following situations:
5.3.3a	If the layer has a resolution ability with a targeted effect, and one or more targets were declared when the layer was put onto the stack, at least one of those targets must still be a legal target - otherwise, the layer fails to resolve.
5.3.3b	If the layer is a triggered-layer created by a triggered effect with a state-trigger condition, the state-trigger condition must be met by the current game state - otherwise, the layer fails to resolve. Example: An attack with phantasm is defended by an attack action card with 6{p}. Before the phantasm triggered-layer effect resolves, the attacking hero plays Blinding Beam, giving the defending card −2{p}. When the phantasm triggered-layer resolves, the game state condition that caused phantasm to trigger is no longer true, therefore the phantasm triggered-layer fails to resolve and does not generate any effects.
5.3.3c	If the layer is an attack-layer, and the source has ceased to exist, or the target of the attack is no longer legal.
5.3.4.	After a layer successfully resolves or fails to resolve, the layer is moved from the stack to the owner’s graveyard, and the turn player gains priority, with the following exceptions:
5.3.4a	A non-card layer ceases to exist instead of being moved to the graveyard.
5.3.4b	A card layer that becomes a permanent is moved to the arena instead of being moved to the graveyard. (See Rule 8.2.4, Rule 8.2.12, Rule 8.2.5, and Rule 8.2.9)
5.3.4c	A card with the type defense reaction becomes a defending card and is moved onto the current chain link instead of being moved to the graveyard. (See Rule 8.1.3)
5.3.4d	A rule or effect states that something happens where the turn player does not have priority instead of the player gaining priority.
5.4.	Static Abilities
5.4.1.	A static ability is an ability that generates effects without resolving a layer on the stack. Static abilities are written as statements.
5.4.2.	Static abilities that are functional generate static continuous effects. (See Rule 6.2.3)
5.4.3.	A meta-static ability is a static ability that generates effects that apply to the rules outside of the game.
5.4.3a	If a meta-static ability that modifies rules outside the game ceases to exist during a game, it does not affect the legality of the rules followed outside the game. Example: Shiyana, Diamond Gemini has the text “You may have specialization cards of any hero in your deck.”. If the player controlling Shiyana has specialization cards in their deck, and during a game Shiyana lost this meta static ability, having specialization cards in the deck is still legal.
5.4.4.	A play-static ability is a static ability that generates effects that apply to the playing of its source card.
5.4.4a	An additional-cost ability is a play-static ability that adds one or more asset-costs and/or effect-costs to play the source card. Additional-cost abilities are typically written in the format “As an additional cost to play this [COST]”, where COST is the additional cost to be paid. An additional-cost ability is optional if the COST of the ability uses the term “may” and must be declared when playing a card (see Rule 5.1.3).
5.4.4b	An alternative-cost ability is a play-static ability that replaces one or more asset-costs and/or effect-costs to play the source card. Alternative-cost abilities are typically written in the format “You may [COST] rather than pay this’s [BASE]”, where COST is the alternative cost to be paid instead of the cards BASE asset-costs and/or effect-costs. Alternative-cost abilities are optional and must be declared when playing a card (see Rule 5.1.3). An alternative cost has no effect on any additional costs that must be paid or modifications to the resource cost.
5.4.4c	If a play-static ability generates a triggered effect, the effect triggers immediately if the trigger condition is met. Triggered effects of play-static abilities are typically written in the format “[EFFECT]. When you do, [Abilities]”, where the trigger condition is playing the card using the proceeding effect of the play-static ability. Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “[COST]. If you do, [ABILITIES]”. Example: Rift Bind has the text “You may play Rift Bind from your banished zone. If you do, it gains +X{p}, where X is the number of ’non-attack’ action cards you have played this turn.”, which is a play static ability that generates a delayed-triggered effect that is triggered when the Rift Bind is played from the banished zone.
5.4.4d	If a play-static ability generates a replacement effect, the effect replaces the card as it is played if the replacement condition is met. Replacement effects of play-static abilities are typically written in the format “[EFFECT]. As you do, [Abilities]”, where the replacement condition is playing the card using the proceeding effect of the play-static ability.
5.4.5.	A property-static ability is a static ability that defines the property, or value of a property, on an object that would normally be found elsewhere on that object. Example: Mutated Mass has the text “Mutated Mass’s {p} and {d} is equal to twice the number of cards in your pitch zone with different costs.”, which is a property-static ability that defines the power and defense of the card, otherwise printed on the card with (*).
5.4.5a	Property-static abilities function anywhere in and outside the game.
5.4.6.	A triggered-static ability is a static ability that generates a single triggered effect. (See Section 6.6 - Triggered Effects)
5.4.6a	If the source of a triggered-static ability ceases to exist from an event that would trigger its effect, and the ability was functional immediately before the event occurs, then the triggered effect is triggered. Example: Merciful Retribution has the text “Whenever an aura or attack action card you control is destroyed, deal 1 arcane damage to target hero. [...]”. If Merciful Retribution is in the arena under the control of a player and is destroyed, its triggered effect will trigger, because the destruction event of Merciful Retribution is also the condition of the effect.
5.4.7.	A while-static ability is a static ability that is functional when its while-condition is met. while-conditional abilities are written in the format “While [CONDITION], [ABILITY]”, where the ABILITY is the static ability that is functional whenever the CONDITION is met. Example: Yinti Yanti has the text “While Yinti Yanti is defending and you control an aura, it has +1 {d} .”, which is a while-static ability that is functional when it is a non-permanent defending card because it has a while-condition that is met when the card is defending.
5.4.7a	A while-static ability can be functional when the source is private as long as the while-condition specifies it.
5.4.7b	A hidden triggered ability is both a while-static ability and triggered-static ability, where the while-condition specifies that the source is private or in a private zone. If the triggered condition is met while the ability is functional and the source is private, the owner may decide to trigger the effect. If they do, the source of the ability becomes public and the triggered effect produces a triggered-layer to be added to the stack. The source remains public until the triggered-layer resolves or otherwise ceases to exist, and then it returns to being private. Example: The Librarian has the text “While The Librarian is face down, at the start of your turn, you may turn him face up.”, which is a hidden triggered ability that is functional when The Librarian is face down in arsenal and the start of turn event occurs. The player decides to trigger the effect, The Librarian becomes public, and when its triggered-layer resolves it is officially turned face up in the arsenal.
6.	Effects
6.0.	General
6.1.	Discrete Effects
6.1.1.	A discrete effect is an effect that changes the game state by producing an event (see Section 1.9 - Events). Discrete effects have no duration, and after the completion of their event, they have no further influence of the game state.
6.1.2.	Discrete effects are atomic. If multiple discrete effects would be generated, they are generated and produce their event one at a time. Example: Sand Sketched Plan has the text “Search your deck for a card, put it into your hand, discard a random card, then shuffle your deck.”, which is resolution ability that generates four atomic discrete effects: search (Rule 8.5.16), put (Rule 8.5.12), discard (Rule 8.5.5), and shuffle (Rule 8.5.17). Each effect is generated and produces an event before the next one in order is generated.
6.1.3.	If a discrete effect is conditional (see 1.8.3), its condition is evaluated only once, at the time the effect would be generated. If the condition is met, the effect is generated - otherwise it is not.
6.2.	Continuous Effects
6.2.1.	A continuous effect modifies the state and properties of objects, and/or the rules of the game. Continuous effects either have a lasting influence effect on the game state, and continue for their specified duration, or for as long as their source ability is functional.
6.2.2.	A layer-continuous effect is a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a layer. Layer continuous effects typically have a specified duration.
6.2.2a	A layer-continuous effect starts as soon it is generated and ends after a specified duration. If no duration is explicitly specified by the effect, then the layer-continuous effect ends when it is no longer applicable.
6.2.2b	If a layer-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the values of those variables are determined when the continuous effect is generated and do not change thereafter. If the effect is a continuous effect that applies to an object that does not yet exist, the variables are determined when the effect first applies to an object and do not change thereafter. Example: Tear Limb from Limb has the text “[...] the next Brute attack action card you play this turn gains +X{p}, where X is its base {p}.”, which is a layer-continuous effect where X is determined at the time the effect first starts to apply to an object, not when it is first generated.
6.2.2c	If a layer-continuous effect starts to apply to an object, it continues to apply to that object even if the properties of that object change. Example: Primeval Bellow (red) has the text “Your next Brute attack this turn gains +5{p}.”. If the player plays and resolves Primeval Bellow, then Pack Hunt (a brute attack); even if the supertype brute of Pack Hunt is removed, the effect of Primeval Bellow will still apply to the Pack Hunt.
6.2.2d	If a layer-continuous effect is conditional on being generated (see 1.8.3), its condition is evaluated only once, at the time the effect would be generated. If the condition is met, the effect is generated - otherwise, it is not. If the effect is conditional on being applied, the condition is still checked continuously (see Rule 1.8.3c).
6.2.3.	A static-continuous effect is a continuous effect generated by a static ability. Static-continuous effects never have a specified duration.
6.2.3a	A static-continuous effect starts as soon as the static ability that generated it becomes functional and ends when the static ability becomes non-functional (see Rule 1.7.5).
6.2.3b	If a static-continuous effect has variable values (such as X), the value of those variables are determined based on the current game state and are updated if the game state changes.
6.2.3c	Static continuous effects only apply to an object while it has the properties described by the effect - if the properties of an object change, the static effect may no longer apply to that object.
6.2.3d	If a static-continuous effect is conditional on being generated (see 1.8.3), its condition is evaluated at all times. The effect is generated when the condition is met and ceases to exist when the condition is not met. Example: Luminaris has the text “If there is a yellow card in your pitch zone, Illusionist attacks you control have go again.”, which is a conditional static-continuous effect that only exists when there is a card with a yellow color strip in the controlling player’s pitch zone and does not exist otherwise.
6.2.4.	If a continuous effect would only apply to a future object that is yet to exist, it starts to apply to the next object that meets the specification of the effect. Example: Come to Fight has the text “The next attack action card you play this turn gains +3{p}.”, which is a layer-continuous effect that applies to the next attack action card the player plays after the generation of the effect.
6.3.	Continuous Effect Interactions
6.3.1.	Continuous effects that modify the rules of the game are applied simultaneously before continuous effects that modify objects. If there are two or more continuous effects that modify the state and/or properties of objects in the game, the effects are applied using the staging system. These effects are grouped into stages and are applied in ascending stage order, then if there are two or more effects in the same stage, the effects are applied using substage order, then timestamp order. Example: Hypothermia has the text “Attacks you control can’t gain go again.”, which is a continuous effect that modifies the rules of the game and is applied before any effects would add the go again ability to an attack you control.
6.3.2.	Stage order is defined by how an effect applies to the object. Effects are grouped into stages and are applied in ascending stage order. If there are two or more effects in the same stage, the effects are applied using substage order (see Rule 6.3.3). • Stage 1: Effects that modify copyable properties applied. (See Rule 8.5.22) • Stage 2: Effects that modify or are dependent on the controller are applied. • Stage 3: Effects that modify or are dependent on name, color strip, or text box are applied. • Stage 4: Effects that modify or are dependent on types or subtypes areapplied. • Stage 5: Effects that modify or are dependent on supertypes are applied. • Stage 6: Effects that modify or are dependent on abilities are applied. • Stage 7: Effects that modify or are dependent on the base values of numeric properties are applied. • Stage 8: Effects and counters that modify or are dependent on the values of numeric properties are applied.
6.3.2a	An effect is dependent on a stage if the application of another effect in that stage would have changed the first application of this effect, and that stage is higher than the stage for this effect. An effect is independent if it is not dependent on any stages. Dependent effects are applied in the stage on which they are dependent. Example: Thump has the text “While Thump’s {p} is greater than its base {p}, it has dominate and ‘When this hits a hero, they discard a card.’ ” which is an effect that is dependent on the value of the power {p} numerical property (stage 8) and affects the object’s abilities (stage 6). Because effects in stage 8 can change the application of Thump’s effect, and stage 8 is higher than stage 3, Thump’s effect is considered dependent and is applied in stage 8 (substage 7).
6.3.2b	If an effect is dependent on two or more stages, it is applied at the highest of all those stages.
6.3.2c	If separate parts of an effect are applied in different stages, the separate parts of the effect each apply in their respective stages.
6.3.3.	Substage order is used if there are two or more effects in the same stage and is defined by the dependence and type of modification within each stage. For stages 1–6, substage order is to apply independent effects before dependent effects. For stages 7–8, effects are grouped into the following substages and are applied in ascending substage order. • Substage 1: All effects that add/remove a numerical property to/from the object are applied. • Substage 2: Independent effects that set the value of a numerical property are applied. • Substage 3: Independent effects that multiple the value of a numerical property are applied. • Substage 4: Independent effects that divide the value of a numerical property are applied. • Substage 5: Independent effects that add to the value of a numerical property are applied. • Substage 6: Independent effects that subtract from the value of a numerical property are applied. • Substage 7: Dependent effects are applied.
6.3.3a	If there are two or more effects in the same substage, the effects are applied using timestamp order (see Rule 6.3.4).
6.3.4.	Timestamp order is used when there are two or more effects in the same substage and is defined by the timestamp of when an effect was first generated. Effects are applied in chronological timestamp order. If there are two or more effects with the same timestamp, the order is determined by the turn player.
6.3.4a	The timestamp of an effect is the moment it was generated by an ability. Layer-continuous effects are generated when their source resolves as a layer on the stack (see Rule 6.2.2) and static-continuous effects are generated when the static ability becomes functional (see Rule 6.2.3).
6.3.4b	If two or more effects start to apply to an object at the same time the turn player decides the order that effects apply. This decided order is only used to determine the order of effects with the same timestamps. Once a player has decided the order of effects, the order can not be changed.
6.3.4c	When a new effect is applied to an object in a given substage of ordered effects, that effect is ordered after the existing effects in that substage.
6.3.5.	Continuous effects are applied automatically, in order, and all modifications to the game state occur instantaneously and are considered a single change in state for purposes of effects. Example: Talisman of Featherfoot has the text “When an attack you control gains exactly +1{p} from an effect during the reaction step, destroy Talisman of Featherfoot and the attack gains go again.”. If an attack has 0 base power and is affected by a -1{p} continuous effect, then it is affected by a new +2{p} effect during the reaction step, the attack’s modified power increases from 0 to 1 which triggers Talisman of Featherfoot’s effect.
6.3.5a	If an object is modified by an effect that would make it eligible/ineligible for another effect in the current or future stage/substage, that effect is added/removed to the set of effects to be applied in that stage/substage. Example: Minnowism (red) has the text “The next attack action card with 3 or less base you play this turn gains +3{p}.”, which is a layer-continuous effect applied in stage 8. If an attack action card with 6 base power is played, and its base power is reduced to 3 in stage 7, it becomes eligible for the application of Minnowism’s effect, which will be added and applied in the later stage 8.
6.3.5b	If an object is modified by an effect that would make it applicable to another effect in a previous stage/substages, that other effect is not retroactively applied.
6.3.6.	Continuous effects that remove a property, or part of a property, from an object do not remove properties, or parts of properties, that were added by another effect. Example: Erase Face has the text “When Erase Face hits a hero, cards and tokens they own lose all class and talent types until the end of their next turn.”, which removes any existing class and talent supertypes of the object, but does not remove or prevent the addition of class and talent supertypes gained from other effects, such as Brand with Cinderclaw.
6.3.7.	Continuous effects only prevent properties, or parts of properties, from being added, removed, or otherwise modified if they explicitly specify. Example: Hypothermia has the text “Attacks you control can’t gain go again.”, which prevents effects from adding the go again ability to the object, but does not remove the go again ability if it is a base ability and derived from either the text box of the object or set as a copyable property of the object.
6.4.	Replacement Effects
6.4.1.	A replacement effect is a type of continuous effect, or a part of a preceding effect, that replaces an event with a modified event. A replacement effect typically specifies the conditions for the event to be replaced and the partial or full replacement of the event.
6.4.2.	When an event is about to occur that satisfies the condition of a replacement effect, the replacement effect is considered active for that event.
6.4.3.	A replacement effect must exist before an event occurs in order to replace it. If a replacement effect is generated after an event occurs, it does not retroactively replace that event.
6.4.4.	A replacement effect can replace an event that has been modified by another replacement effect, as long as the effect is active for that modified event.
6.4.5.	A replacement effect can only replace an event once per original event. It can not replace its own modified event, or any further modified events produced other replacement effects if it has already replaced the event.
6.4.6.	If an event is replaced, the original event does not occur and the modified event occurs instead. The modified event may trigger abilities and cause other replacement effects to be active that the original event would not have.
6.4.7.	A self-replacement effect is a replacement effect that is either part of a preceding effect generated by the same ability or an independent effect that applies to an effect generated by a leading connected ability (see Rule 1.7.7). A self-replacement effect is typically written in the format “[CONDITION], instead [MODIFICATION]”, where EFFECT (if any) is the preceding effect the replacement applies to, CONDITION specifies the replacement condition, and MODIFICATION specifies the partial or full replacement of the event created by the preceding effect. Example: Weave Earth (red) has the text “The next Earth or Elemental attack action card you play this turn gains +3{p}. If it’s fused, instead it gains +4{p}.”, which is a layer-continuous and self-replacement effect. When an Earth or Elemental attack action card is played and is fused, the self-replacement part of the effect replaces the preceding layer-continuous part of the effect, and the card gains +4{p}.
6.4.7a	A self-replacement effect does not modify any event other than the event created by the proceeding effect on its source, or the effect of the leading connected ability.
6.4.8.	A identity-replacement effect is a static-continuous replacement effect. Identity-replacement effects are typically written in the format “As this enters the arena [MODIFICATION]”, or “this enters the arena (as/with) [MODIFICATION]”, where MODIFICATION describes the modifications to the object as it enters the arena.
6.4.8a	The condition of an identity-replacement effect is its source is moving into the arena.
6.4.8b	An identity-replacement effect that modifies the properties of its source defines its copyable properties.
6.4.9.	A standard-replacement effect is a continuous replacement effect. A standard-replacement effect is typically written in the format “(If / The next) [CONDITION], instead [MODIFICATION]”, where CONDITION specifies the condition for the replacement effect to be active, and MODIFICATION describes the modifications to the effect before it occurs. Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “(When / Whenever) [CONDITION] instead [EFFECT]”.
6.4.10.	A prevention effect is a replacement effect that replaces a damage event with a modified event. Prevention effects are typically written in a format “[CONDITION?] prevent [PREVENTION]”, where the CONDITION (if any) specifies the replacement condition, and PREVENTION is the modification which specifies the total amount of damage the effect can prevent damage type(s) (if any), the protected object(s) and/or source(s) of the damage event, and additional modifications to the event (if any).
6.4.10a	If a prevention effect is active for a damage event, for every 1 damage of the given type that would be dealt to the protected object from the damage source, the damage is prevented and the remaining prevention amount of the effect is reduced by 1. If the prevention amount has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt as normal.
6.4.10b	If the prevention damage type is not specified, the prevention applies to any and all damage types. If the prevention damage type is specified, the prevention only applies to that type of damage.
6.4.10c	If the source of the damage event is not specified, the prevention applies to all damage that applies to the specified protected object(s).
6.4.10d	If the protected object is not specified, the prevent applies to all damage dealt by the specified source(s) of the damage event.
6.4.10e	If there are two or more types of damage in the event that the prevention can apply to, and/or two or more protected objects the damage event will deal damage to, the controller of the prevention effect declares each point of damage the effect will prevent.
6.4.10f	If an effect states that a prevention effect can not prevent the damage of an event, the prevention effect still applies to the event but its prevention amount is not reduced. Any additional modifications to the event by the prevention effect still occur. Example: Spectral Shield has the text “If your hero would be dealt damage, instead destroy Spectral Shield and prevent 1 damage that source would deal.”, which is a fixed-prevention effect with an additional modification that destroys the source. If a damage event occurs that can not be prevented, Spectral Shield’s prevention effect applies once to the event but does not reduce the damage dealt and Spectral Shield is still destroyed. Example: Steadfast has the text “Prevent the next 6 damage that would be dealt to your hero this turn by a source of your choice.”, which is an ongoing-prevention effect. If a damage event occurs that can not be prevented, Steadfast’s prevention effect applies once to the event, but does not reduce the damage dealt and does not have its prevention amount reduced. As such will still be able to prevent a total of 6 damage from the source after the event.
6.4.10g	A fixed-prevention effect is a prevention effect that prevents a specific amount of damage of an event that activates it. Fixed-prevention effects are typically written in the format “[CONDITION], prevent [PREVENTION]”. After a fixed-prevention effect prevents damage, any remaining prevention amount is not used to prevent a subsequent damage event. Example: Dissipation Shield has the text “Instant - Destroy Dissipation Shield: The next time your hero would be dealt damage this turn, prevent X damage, where X is the number of steam counters on Dissipation Shield.”, which fixed-prevention effect that applies to the next event that would deal damage to your hero this turn but does not to any further damage events that turn.
6.4.10h	An ongoing-prevention effect is a prevention effect that prevents a specific amount of damage from any number of events that activate it. Ongoing-prevention effects are typically written in the format “[CONDITION?] prevent the next [PREVENTION]”. After an ongoing-prevention effect prevents damage, any remaining prevention amount is used to prevent a future damage event. If the prevention amount of an ongoing-prevention effect is reduced to zero, the effect ceases to exist. Example: Bone Head Barrier has the text “Roll a 6 sided die. Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to your hero this turn, where X is the number rolled.”, which is an ongoing-prevention effect that applies to every event that would deal damage to your hero this turn until X damage has been prevented in total.
6.5.	Replacement Effect Interactions
6.5.1.	If there are two or more replacement effects that could replace an event with a modified event, then effects are applied based on an order determined by the turn player and then an order determined by each controlling player.
6.5.2.	Select Player: First, the turn player selects a remaining player. When a type of replacement effect is applied, each player applies their active replacement effects of that type one-by-one until they do not control any more active replacement effects of that type; starting with the selected player and ending when there are no more active replacement effects of that type to apply.
6.5.2a	The turn player does not determine the order of effects they do not control, only the first player to apply replacement effects.
6.5.2b	The selected player is determined once per event and does not change.
6.5.3.	Self-replacement and Identity-replacement: Second, each player applies any self- or identity- replacement effects they control.
6.5.4.	Standard-replacement: Third, each player applies any active standard-replacement effects they control.
6.5.5.	Prevention: Fourth, each player applies any active prevention effects they control.
6.5.6.	Fifth and finally, the event occurs.
6.6.	Triggered Effects
6.6.1.	A triggered effect is an effect that can be triggered to put a triggered-layer on the stack. Triggered effects are typically written in the format “[LIMIT?] (When / Whenever / At / The [ORDINAL] time / The next time) [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]”. Triggered effects never use the term “instead” (see Section 6.4 - Replacement Effects). Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “If [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]” and “[LIMIT?] effect - (When / Whenever) [EVENT and/or STATE] [ABILITIES]”.
6.6.1a	The LIMIT (if any) specifies the trigger limit, which maximum number of times the effect can be triggered. If there is no limit, the effect can be triggered any number of times.
6.6.1b	The ORDINAL (if any) is one or more ordinal numbers that specify which event(s) within the given duration will match the trigger condition.
6.6.1c	The EVENT and/or STATE specifies the event- and/or state-trigger condition that triggers the effect and creates a triggered-layer. If the triggered condition describes an event (or an event and state), the effect is an event-based triggered effect; if the trigger condition describes a game state, the effect is a state-based triggered effect.
6.6.1d	The ABILITIES specifies the resolution abilities of the triggered-layer created by the effect. When the triggered-layer resolves, the resolution abilities of the layer generate effects.
6.6.2.	An inline-triggered effect is a discrete triggered effect that can only trigger when it is generated. Inline-triggered effects are typically written in the format “When [CONDITION] [EFFECT]”. Example: Belittle has the text “As an additional cost to play Belittle, you may reveal an attack action card with 3 or less base p from your hand. When you do, search your deck for a card named Minnowism, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your deck.”, where the latter effect is an inline-triggered effect that is conditional on the payment of the preceding effect-cost.
6.6.2a	An inline-triggered effect does not trigger retroactively if the condition is met after the effect is generated.
6.6.3.	A delayed-triggered effect is a layer-continuous triggered effect. Delayed triggered effects typically contain, but do not start with the phrase “(when / whenever / at / the [ORDINAL] time / the next time)”, or they start with the phrase “The next time”.
6.6.3a	A delayed triggered effect always specifies its duration, unless it is conditional on a change in phase (end of turn) or step (combat chain closes), in which case the effect lasts until it is triggered.
6.6.4.	A static-triggered effect is a static-continuous triggered effect. Static triggered effects typically start with the phrase “[LIMIT?] (When / Whenever)” or “At / The [ORDINAL] time)”. Note: Cards printed before 2022 have also used the format “[LIMIT] Effect — [EFFECT]”, where LIMIT (if any) specifies the maximum number of times the triggered effect can be triggered, and EFFECT specifies the triggered effect of the ability. Example: Rhinar has the text “When you discard a card with 6 or more {p} during your action phase, intimidate.”, which is a static-triggered effect that triggers and creates a triggered-layer when you discard a card with 6 or more {p}, and when that triggered-layer resolves, the intimidate effect is generated.
6.6.5.	If a game event or game state meets a triggered effect’s trigger condition, the effect is considered triggered. When an effect is triggered, it creates a triggered-layer.
6.6.5a	A triggered effect must exist before an event or change in state occurs that satisfies its trigger condition, for it to be triggered. If a triggered effect is generated after an event or change in state occurs that satisfies its trigger condition, it does not retroactively trigger. The exception is inline- triggered effects, which triggers as it is generated if its trigger condition is met.
6.6.5b	An event-based triggered effect only triggers if an event that meets the triggered condition occurs. If the event is modified before it occurs and no longer meets the triggered condition, the effect does not trigger (see Section 6.4 - Replacement Effects). If the trigger condition also includes a state-trigger condition, that condition must also be met by the game state at the time the event occurs for the effect to trigger.
6.6.5c	A state-based triggered effect only triggers if the game state did not initially meet the trigger condition, then changes and meets the trigger condition.
6.6.5d	If the trigger condition is proceeded by an ordinal as part of the condition, the effect will only trigger on the specified ordinal time(s) the condition is met, relative to the specified duration. If the effect becomes functional after the specified ordinal time(s) the condition would be met, the effect will not trigger for the rest of the specified duration. Example: If a card has the text “The first time you boost each turn, gain an action point.”, and it put into the arena as a permanent after you’ve boosted that turn, it will not trigger the next time you boost that turn because the ordinal time “first” is relative to the turn and has already happened.
6.6.5e	If the triggered effect is triggered, but it would exceed the maximum number of times specified by the trigger limit (if any), the triggered-layer is not created and will not be added to the stack.
6.6.5f	If the triggered effect is triggered, but there is an effect that prevents it from triggering, the triggered-layer is not created and will not added to the stack. However, the triggering still counts towards the limit of the effect (if any). Example: Katsu has the text “The first time an attack action card you control hits each turn, [...]” and Tripwire Trap has the text ”Hit effects don’t trigger this chain link [...]”. If the Tripwire Trap continuous effect is active and the player that controls Katsu hits with an attack action card, the Katsu triggered effect will not produce a triggered-layer on the stack because Tripwire Trap continuous effect prevents it. The next time this turn the player that controls Katsu hits with an attack action card, the Katsu triggered effect will not produce a triggered-layer on the stack because the once per turn limit has already been reached.
6.6.6.	When a triggered-layer is created, it is added to the stack before the next player receives priority as a game state process. (See Rule 1.10.2)
6.6.6a	When a triggered-layer is added to the stack, the player that controls the effect must declare the parameters of all abilities of that layer. If the card has any modal resolution abilities, the player must declare the modes for those abilities (see Rule 1.7.6). Then, if any resolution abilities generate effects that require a target, the player must declare all legal targets for those effects Rule 1.8.4.	If no legal targets can be declared, the triggered-layer ceases to exist and is not added to the stack.
7.	Combat
7.0.	General
7.0.1.	Combat is a game state where the combat chain is open and attacks undergo resolution in steps on the stack and combat chain. The resolution of a chain link consists of seven steps in order: Layer, Attack, Defend, Reaction, Damage, Resolution, and Link.
7.0.2.	An attack is either a card with the subtype attack on the stack, an attack-layer, or an attacking object. (See Rule 1.2.4)
7.0.3.	The combat chain starts closed. If the combat chain is closed and an attack is added to the stack, the combat chain opens and the Layer Step begins immediately. The combat chain remains open until it is closed again (see Rule 7.8.2).
7.0.4.	A card or ability with the subtype attack cannot be played/activated if a rule or effect would prevent the player from attacking with that card/ability.
7.0.5.	When a player plays or activates an attack, they must declare an attackable object controlled by an opponent as the target of the attack.
7.0.5a	An object is attackable if it is a living object (see Rule 2.5.1), or if it is made attackable by an effect. Example: The ability Spectra generates an effect that makes its source a legal target for an attack, despite it not being a living object.
7.0.5b	The target of an attack remains the target of that attack until the combat chain closes. The player does not have to declare the same target as a previous attack on the combat chain and declaring a different target does not close the combat chain.
7.0.6.	When a layer is added to the stack while the combat chain is open, it is considered to be played/activated/triggered on chain link N where N is the highest chain link, for the purposes of rules and effects. If there are no chain links on the combat chain it is not considered to be played/activated/triggered on any chain link.
7.0.7.	During combat, while the combat chain is open, a player can not play cards or activate activated abilities with the type action, except during the Link Step of combat. (See Section 7.7 - Link Step)
7.0.7a	An action card/ability can still be played/activated as an instant during any step of combat when a player has priority.
7.1.	Layer Step
7.1.1.	The Layer Step is a game state where an attack is unresolved on the stack.
7.1.2.	First, the turn player gains priority.
7.1.3.	Second and finally, when the top layer of the stack is the attack and all players pass in succession, the Layer Step ends and the Attack Step begins.
7.2.	Attack Step
7.2.1.	The Attack Step is a game state where an attack resolves and becomes attacking before any defending cards are declared.
7.2.2.	First, if the target of the attack does not exist, or is an illegal target, the Attack Step ends and the Close Step begins (see Section 7.8 - Close Step).
7.2.3.	Second, the attack moves to the combat chain as a chain link (see Rule 3.5.4). If the attack is an attack-layer, it ceases to exist and its source (attack-source) becomes the attack instead and moves to the combat chain as a chain link. The resolution abilities of the attack resolve and generate effects (with the exception of the ability go again, see Rule 8.3.5). Note: Attacks with resolution abilities that generate discrete effects printed before 2021 have received an errata that corrects them to be triggered effects that trigger when the attack becomes attacking. Example: Salt the Wounds has the text “Salt the Wound gains +1{p} for each attack that has hit this combat chain.”, a resolution ability that generates a continuous effect as Salt the Wounds becomes a chain link on the combat chain.
7.2.3a	If the attack-source of an attack-layer becomes the attack, effects that applied to the attack-layer now apply to the attack-source and the attack- source is considered to have the base abilities of the attack-layer. These effects and abilities apply to the attack-source as long as it remains that chain link on the combat chain. Example: Sharpen Steel has the text “Your next weapon attack this turn gains +3{p}.”. When a weapon is activated to create an attack-layer on the stack, Sharpen Steel’s effect begins to apply to the attack-layer. When the weapon becomes the attack and chain link on the combat chain, Sharpen Steel’s effect that applied to the attack-layer, now applies to the weapon as the chain link. Example: Edge of Autumn has the text “Once per Turn Action - {r}: Attack. Go again.”. When a weapon is activated to create an attack-layer on the stack, it has the base ability ‘go again’. When the weapon becomes the attack and chain link on the combat chain, it is considered to have ‘go again’ for that chain link.
7.2.3b	An effect that applies to an attack-source specifically as a chain link, only apply to the attack-source while it represents that chain link on the combat chain. If the attack-source becomes a new chain link on the combat chain, these effects do not apply to the attack-source as the new chain link.
7.2.3c	If the attack-source was a chain link before it becomes a new chain link, the previous chain link continues to exist and Last Known Information is used. (See Rule 3.5.4b)
7.2.4.	Third, the attack is considered to be attacking until it leaves the combat chain. The “attack” event occurs and effects that trigger from attacking are triggered. Example: The attack is Dread Triptych. The abilities “When you attack with Dread Triptych, if you’ve played a ’non-attack’ action card this turn, create a Runechant token.” and “When you attack with Dread Triptych, if you’ve dealt arcane damage this turn, create a Runechant token.” trigger and are added as separate triggered-layers on the stack.
7.2.4a	If the attack is an attack ability, then its source is moved onto the current chain link and the source is considered to be “attacking” until the current chain link resolves. If the source is already on another chain link, it is still moved to the current chain link. Example: If the player activates an attack ability on an ally object, the ally moves to the chain link of its attack and becomes an “attacking ally” until its attack resolves.
7.2.4b	If the attack is a card or activated attack created by an attack ability from a non-living object (see Rule 2.5.1), then the controller of the attack and their hero card become the “attacking hero” until the current chain link resolves, for the purposes of rules and effects.
7.2.4c	The target (if any) of the attack is considered to be defending. If the target of the attack is a hero, that hero and their controller become the “defending hero” until the current chain link resolves, for the purposes of rules and effects.
7.2.5.	Fourth, the turn player gains priority.
7.2.6.	Fifth and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Attack Step ends and the Defend Step begins.
7.3.	Defend Step
7.3.1.	The Defend Step is a game state where defending objects are initially declared.
7.3.2.	First, the defending hero (if any) declares any number of non-defense reaction cards from their hand and/or objects with the type equipment they control. Objects declared this way are considered to be “defending” on the current chain link. The “defend” event occurs and effects that trigger from defending are triggered.
7.3.2a	If there is no defending hero, then no defending objects are declared. Otherwise, the defending hero must declare all objects simultaneously, or declare that they are not defending with any objects.
7.3.2b	The defending hero cannot defend with an object that is already a defending object on another chain link.
7.3.2c	An object must have the defense property to be declared this way (0 is a value). If an object does not have the defense property, it can not become defending.
7.3.2d	Defending with a card this way is not considered playing the card. It does not incur the cost for playing that card, it does not add it as a layer on the stack, nor does it resolve any resolution abilities on that card.
7.3.2e	If two or more objects are declared this way, all defending objects are considered to be put onto the current chain link simultaneously in a single compound event. The defending hero decides the order of the defending cards within the compound event for the purposes of effects. (See Rule 1.9.2)
7.3.3.	Second, the turn player gains priority.
7.3.4.	Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Defend Step ends and the Reaction Step begins.
7.4.	Reaction Step
7.4.1.	The Reaction Step is a game state where players may use reactions related to combat.
7.4.2.	First, the turn player gains priority.
7.4.2a	The attacking hero (if any) can play/activate attack reaction cards/abilities when they have priority during the Reaction Step.
7.4.2b	The defending hero (if any) can play/activate defense reaction cards/abilities when they have priority during the Reaction Step.
7.4.2c	A defense reaction card/ability cannot be played/activated if a rule or effect would prevent the player from defending with that card/ability.
7.4.2d	When a defense reaction card resolves it becomes a defending card and the defending hero is considered to have defended with it. The “defend” event occurs and effects that trigger from defending with a card are triggered.
7.4.3.	Second and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Reaction Step ends and the Damage Step begins.
7.5.	Damage Step
7.5.1.	The Damage Step is a game state where the physical damage of the chain link is calculated and applied. Players do not get priority during the Damage Step.
7.5.2.	First and only, if the power of the attack is greater than the sum total defense value of defending objects on the current chain link, the attack deals {p} damage (physical damage) to the target (if any) equal to the difference. Then the Damage Step ends and the Resolution Step begins. Example: If the power of the attack is 6, and there are two defending cards with a defense 3 and 2 respectively then the sum total defense value of the defending objects is 5. The power of the attack is greater than the sum total defense, so the target is dealt 6 − 5 = 1 {p} damage.
7.5.2a	Dealing {p} damage to the attack target this way, is a hit-event generated by the game (Rule 7.5.3). The source of the damage is the attack.
7.5.2b	If the target has ceased to exist or is illegal when the damage is calculated, no damage is dealt, and the effect is not generated.
7.5.3.	An attack is considered to have hit if it deals damage to the attack target during the Damage Step of combat. The hit-event is a composite event that includes the internal event of {p} damage being dealt to the target and only occurs during the Damage Step of combat. (See Rule 1.9.3)
7.5.3a	If the target loses life as a result of anything except damage dealt by the attack, then the attack is not considered to have hit.
7.5.3b	If the internal event of dealing does not occur (the target is not dealt any damage), then the hit- event does not occur and the attack is not considered to have hit. Example: Feign Death has the text “The next time you would be dealt damage this turn, prevent it.”. If the effect from Feign Death prevents the all damage dealt by the attack, no damage is dealt, the hit-event does not occur, and the attack is not considered to have hit.
7.5.3c	If the damage event is modified such that the attack is not the source of any damage dealt to the target (the target is dealt damage, but not by the attack), the event no longer a composite hit-event and the attack is not considered to have hit. This is the exception to the composite-event rule Rule 1.9.3.
7.6.	Resolution Step
7.6.1.	The Resolution Step is a game state where the current chain link resolves.
7.6.2.	First, the current chain link is considered to be resolved and effects that trigger when the chain link resolves are triggered.
7.6.3.	Second, the turn player gains priority.
7.6.4.	Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Resolution Step ends and the Link Step begins.
7.7.	Link Step
7.7.1.	The Link Step is a game state where the combat can either continue with the chain of attacks or close the combat chain.
7.7.2.	First, if the attack has go again, its controller gains 1 action point.
7.7.2a	If the attack is no longer on the combat chain, the last known information of the attack is used to determine whether the attack has go again.
7.7.3.	Second, the turn player gains priority. The turn player may play an attack action card or activate an attack ability. If an attack is added to the stack, the Link Step ends and the Layer Step begins.
7.7.4.	Third and finally, when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, the Link Step ends and the Close Step begins.
7.8.	Close Step
7.8.1.	The Close Step is a game state where the combat chain closes and combat ends. Players do not get priority during the Close Step.
7.8.2.	If a rule or effect causes the combat chain to close, the current step (if any) ends, and the Close Step immediately begins. The combat chain closes from the following:
7.8.2a	If all players pass in succession when the stack is empty during the Link Step. (See Rule 7.7.4)
7.8.2b	If the target of the attack ceases to exist before the attack becomes attacking, at the beginning of the Attack step. (See Rule 7.2.2)
7.8.2c	If the attack of the current chain link ceases to exist before the chain link resolves, at the beginning of the Resolution Step of combat. (See Rule 7.6.2) Example: Luminaris has the text “[...] Illusionist auras you control are weapons with 1{p} and “Once per Turn Action — 0: Attack””. If a Spectral Shield token is activated to attack the opponent, and the token is destroyed before the Resolution Step, the activated attack will also cease to exist, and the Close Step will begin.
7.8.2d	If an effect closes the combat chain. Example: The Phantasm and Spectra triggered effects close the combat chain when the triggered-layer resolves on the stack.
7.8.3.	First, the combat chain closes. The “combat chain closes” event occurs and abilities that trigger from the combat chain closing are triggered. All cards and activated abilities on the stack with the attack reaction type, defense reaction type, and/or attack subtype, are put into their owner’s graveyard.
7.8.4.	Second, layers on the stack resolve, and additional triggered-layers are added as if all players are passing priority in succession.
7.8.5.	Third, when the stack is empty, all permanents remaining on the combat chain return to their respective zones. Equipment, and weapons, that started the game in any of the arms, chest, head, legs, and weapon zones return to their respective zones. Any other permanent returns to the permanent zone.
7.8.6.	Fourth, all remaining objects on the combat chain are cleared. (See Rule 3.0.12)
7.8.7.	Fifth and finally, the Close Step ends, and the Action Phase continues.
8.	Keywords
8.0.	General
8.0.1.	A keyword is a reserved term or phrase that serves as a descriptive element for rules and/or effects to reference or has some rules meaning.
8.0.2.	A type/subtype keyword is a keyword used by a card’s text box to describe the type/subtype of an object.
8.0.3.	An ability keyword is a keyword that substitutes for the rules text of an ability.
8.0.4.	A label keyword is a keyword that groups abilities with common effects. A label keyword and its ability are typically written in the format “[KEYWORD] — [ABILITY]”.
8.0.5.	An effect keyword is a keyword that substitutes for the rules text of an effect.
8.0.6.	A token keyword is a keyword that refers to a specific token. A token keyword is typically written in the format “[KEYWORD] token”.
8.1.	Type Keywords
8.1.1.	Action
8.1.1a	A card/activated ability with the type action can only be played/activated when the stack is empty unless it is played/activated as an instant.
8.1.1b	A card/activated ability with the type action cannot be played/activated during combat, except during the link step unless it is played/activated as an instant. (See Rule 7.0.7)
8.1.1c	A card/activated ability with the type action has the additional assetcost of one action point to play/activate, unless it is played/activated as an instant. (See Rule 5.1.6)
8.1.1d	If a card/activated ability with the type action is played as an instant, it retains the type action and does not gain the type instant.
8.1.2.	Attack Reaction
8.1.2a	A card or activated ability with the type attack reaction can only be played or activated by a player who controls an attacking hero during the reaction step. (See Section 7.4 - Reaction Step)
8.1.2b	When a card with the type attack reaction resolves as a layer on the stack, it is put onto the current chain link.
8.1.2c	An attack reaction card or activated ability is considered to be a reaction card/ability.
